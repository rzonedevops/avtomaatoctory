# FAUCITT FAMILY TRUST - KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

**Analysis Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Trust Number:** IT 3651/2013  
**Repository:** rzonedevops/analysis

---

## Executive Summary

The Faucitt Family Trust is an inter vivos discretionary trust established under South African law on November 11, 2013, and registered with the Master of the High Court on December 5, 2013. The trust was created by Peter Andrew Faucitt with himself and his spouse Jacqueline Faucitt as trustees and beneficiaries, along with their son Daniel James Faucitt as an additional beneficiary. A critical finding is the trust's acquisition of a R10,000 claim against **Regima Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd** in April 2014, establishing a direct financial connection between the trust and the Regima corporate structure.

## 1. Trust Structure and Control

### Parties and Roles

The trust exhibits a highly centralized control structure where Peter Andrew Faucitt holds multiple roles simultaneously:

| Name | ID Number | Roles | Control Level |
|------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Peter Andrew Faucitt** | 520430 5708 185 | Founder, Trustee, Beneficiary | **Complete Control** |
| Jacqueline Faucitt | 570607 0898 181 | Trustee, Beneficiary | Co-trustee |
| Daniel James Faucitt | 820715 5300 182 | Beneficiary | No control |

**Key Finding:** Peter Faucitt, as founder, retains the power to appoint new trustees during his lifetime (Clause 3.2), giving him ultimate control over trust governance even if he were to step down as trustee.

### Control Mechanisms

The trust deed grants extraordinary powers to the trustees, including:

1. **Investment Authority** - Unrestricted investment powers beyond statutory limitations, requiring only founder authorization for non-standard investments (Clause 6.2)
2. **Borrowing Powers** - Unlimited authority to borrow money and mortgage trust assets (Clause 6.11)
3. **Lending Authority** - Power to make secured or unsecured loans to any person, including trustees, directors, shareholders, or beneficiaries (Clause 6.15)
4. **Termination Discretion** - Trustees have sole and absolute discretion to terminate the trust at any time (Clause 15)
5. **Income and Capital Distribution** - Complete discretion over distribution to beneficiaries (Clauses 6.31, 6.32)

**Key Finding:** The combination of founder control over trustee appointments and broad trustee powers creates a structure where Peter Faucitt maintains comprehensive control over all trust assets and decisions.

## 2. Financial Connections to Regima Group

### Memorandum of Agreement (April 10, 2014)

The most significant finding is the documented transfer of a financial claim from Peter and Jacqueline Faucitt personally to the Faucitt Family Trust:

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Transaction Date** | April 10, 2014 (4 months after trust registration) |
| **Registration Date** | June 18, 2014 (stamped by Master of High Court) |
| **Cedents** | Peter Andrew Faucitt and Jacqueline Faucitt (personally) |
| **Cessionary** | Faucitt Family Trust (IT3651/2013) |
| **Debtor** | **Regima Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd** |
| **Claim Amount** | **R10,000.00** |

**Critical Analysis:**

This transaction establishes several important facts:

1. **Pre-existing Relationship** - Peter and Jacqueline Faucitt had a claim against Regima Worldwide Distribution (RWD) prior to April 2014, indicating a pre-existing business relationship or transaction.

2. **Asset Transfer Strategy** - The cession of this claim to the trust occurred only 4 months after trust establishment, suggesting the trust may have been created, at least in part, to hold claims or assets related to the Regima business operations.

3. **Legal Recognition** - The transaction was formally registered with the Master of the High Court, giving it legal validity and creating an official record of the trust's financial interest in RWD.

4. **Timing Significance** - The claim predates the trust's creation (November 2013), meaning the Faucitts had dealings with RWD before establishing the trust structure.

**Key Finding:** The trust has a documented, legally registered financial claim against Regima Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd, establishing a direct financial connection between the trust and the Regima corporate structure that you have identified as problematic.

---

## 3. Trustee Powers and Asset Protection

### Extraordinary Trustee Powers

The trust deed grants trustees powers that go significantly beyond standard trust provisions:

**Financial Powers:**
- Create further trusts for beneficiaries (Clause 6.34)
- Lend to related parties without restriction (Clause 6.15)
- Borrow unlimited amounts (Clause 6.11)
- Invest in any securities with founder approval (Clause 6.2)
- Apply capital for beneficiary advancement without age restrictions (Clause 6.32)

**Administrative Powers:**
- Execute all legal documents (Clause 6.24)
- Institute or defend legal proceedings (Clause 6.23)
- Determine what constitutes capital vs. income (Clause 6.13)
- Pay beneficiaries in cash or in specie at trustee valuation (Clause 6.30)
- Accumulate income indefinitely (Clause 14)

**Key Finding:** These powers allow trustees to restructure assets, create subsidiary trusts, and move value between entities with minimal oversight, potentially facilitating complex asset protection or wealth transfer strategies.

### Asset Protection Mechanisms

The trust deed includes several provisions that protect trust assets from creditors:

1. **Exclusion from Community of Property** - All trust benefits are excluded from matrimonial property regimes (Clause 17)

2. **Anti-Attachment Provisions** - Trust assets cannot be attached by creditors before distribution (Clause 18.1)

3. **Suspension on Insolvency** - If a beneficiary becomes insolvent, their rights are suspended and trustees may apply assets for maintenance (Clauses 18.2-18.4)

4. **Discretionary Distribution** - No beneficiary has a vested right to any trust asset until trustees decide to distribute

**Key Finding:** The trust structure provides significant protection of assets from creditors, matrimonial claims, and insolvency proceedings, which could be used to shield assets from legitimate claims.

---

## 4. Governance and Oversight

### Limited External Oversight

The trust structure minimizes external oversight:

| Oversight Mechanism | Status | Implication |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Annual Audit** | Not required | No independent financial review |
| **Master's Supervision** | Minimal (registration only) | No ongoing monitoring |
| **Beneficiary Rights** | Discretionary only | No enforceable claims |
| **Trustee Security** | Waived (Clause 4) | No financial guarantee required |
| **Trustee Indemnity** | Broad protection (Clause 13) | Limited liability for trustees |

**Auditor Appointment:**

D J Bantjes was appointed as auditor/accountant with the following undertakings:
- Notify Master of resignation
- Report non-compliance with trust deed
- Report substantial capital additions
- Maintain trust records

**Key Finding:** While an auditor was appointed, annual audits are not required, and the auditor's role appears limited to compliance monitoring rather than independent financial oversight.

### Decision-Making Structure

The trust deed provides for:

1. **Majority Rule** - Decisions made by majority of trustees (Clause 10.1)
2. **Deadlock Resolution** - Arbitration by advocate from Johannesburg bar (Clause 10.2)
3. **Founder Override** - Founder can appoint/remove trustees during his lifetime (Clause 3.2)

**Key Finding:** With only two trustees (both Faucitts), all decisions are effectively unanimous or subject to Peter Faucitt's founder authority, eliminating independent oversight.

## 5. Timeline and Registration

### Key Dates and Sequence

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **November 11, 2013** | Trust deed signed | Trust established |
| **November 27, 2013** | Trustee acceptance forms | Trustees formally accept |
| **December 5, 2013** | Trust registered | Legal recognition granted |

| **April 10, 2014** | Memorandum of Agreement signed | RWD claim transferred to trust |
| **June 18, 2014** | Memorandum registered | Official record of RWD claim |
| **October 18, 2024** | Letter to Daniel Bantjies | Recent trust activity |

**Key Finding:** The trust was operational for only 4 months before acquiring the RWD claim, suggesting rapid deployment for specific financial purposes. The 2024 letter to Daniel Bantjies indicates ongoing trust activity and possible changes in trust administration or beneficiary involvement.

---

## 6. Beneficiary Structure and Succession

### Current Beneficiaries

The trust has three beneficiaries with different levels of involvement:

1. **Peter Andrew Faucitt** - Founder, trustee, and beneficiary (complete control)
2. **Jacqueline Faucitt** - Trustee and beneficiary (co-control)
3. **Daniel James Faucitt** - Beneficiary only (no control, passive interest)

**Key Finding:** Daniel James Faucitt is named as a beneficiary but has no control over the trust. The October 2024 letter addressed to him may indicate:
- Potential succession planning
- Changes in trust administration
- Possible dispute or clarification of his rights
- Preparation for his involvement as trustee

### Succession and Termination

The trust deed provides:

1. **Indefinite Duration** - Trust continues until trustees decide to terminate (Clause 15)
2. **Trustee Succession** - After founder's death, trustees appoint successors (Clause 3.3)
3. **Termination Discretion** - Trustees have sole discretion on termination timing
4. **Asset Distribution** - On termination, assets vest in beneficiaries

**Key Finding:** The trust can continue indefinitely across generations, and the trustees (currently the Faucitts) control when and how it terminates, providing long-term asset protection and control.

## 7. Banking and Financial Infrastructure

### Banking Arrangements

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Bank** | First National Bank |
| **Division** | Private Clients |
| **Location** | Johannesburg |
| **Branch Code** | 258605 |
| **Account Opening** | Immediate upon registration |

**Key Finding:** The use of FNB Private Clients suggests significant assets or high-net-worth status, as this division typically serves affluent clients with specialized banking needs.

---

## 8. Legal and Regulatory Compliance

### Registration and Authorization

The trust is properly registered and authorized:

1. **Master's Registration** - Registered with Master of the High Court, South Gauteng
2. **Letters of Authority** - Official authorization issued to both trustees
3. **Deed Registration** - Trust deed properly executed and stamped
4. **Auditor Appointment** - Qualified chartered accountant appointed

**Key Finding:** The trust is legally compliant and properly registered, giving it full legal standing to hold assets, enter contracts, and conduct business.

### Regulatory Framework

The trust operates under:
- **Trust Property Control Act, 1988 (Act 57 of 1988)** - Primary governing legislation
- **Master of the High Court** - Regulatory oversight authority
- **South African law** - Jurisdiction for all trust matters

---

## 9. Strategic Implications

### Trust as Asset Protection Vehicle

The trust structure provides multiple layers of asset protection:

1. **Separate Legal Entity** - Trust assets are separate from personal assets
2. **Creditor Protection** - Assets protected from personal creditors
3. **Matrimonial Protection** - Excluded from community of property
4. **Discretionary Distribution** - No vested beneficiary rights
5. **Flexible Structure** - Can create further trusts or restructure

**Key Finding:** The trust is structured to provide maximum asset protection while maintaining family control, which could be used legitimately for estate planning or potentially for shielding assets from legitimate claims.

### Connection to Regima Corporate Structure

The documented R10,000 claim against Regima Worldwide Distribution establishes:

1. **Direct Financial Link** - Trust has a legal claim against RWD
2. **Pre-existing Relationship** - Faucitts had dealings with RWD before trust creation
3. **Asset Transfer Pattern** - Personal claims transferred to trust structure
4. **Potential for Further Transactions** - Trust powers allow for additional dealings with related entities

**Key Finding:** The trust is not isolated from the Regima business operations but is directly connected through the documented claim against RWD. This suggests the trust may be part of a broader corporate and asset structure involving multiple Regima entities.

## 10. Areas of Concern and Further Investigation

### Questions Raised by the Evidence

1. **Nature of Original Claim** - What was the basis for the R10,000 claim against RWD? Was it a loan, unpaid services, goods supplied, or another transaction?

2. **Claim Status** - Has the R10,000 claim been paid? If so, when and how? If not, why not after 10+ years?

3. **Additional Transactions** - Are there other transactions between the trust and Regima entities not documented in these records?

4. **Trust Assets** - Beyond the initial R100 donation and the RWD claim, what other assets does the trust hold?

5. **Daniel Bantjies Letter (2024)** - Why was Daniel Bantjies (the auditor) sent a letter in October 2024? What does this indicate about current trust activity?

6. **Daniel James Faucitt's Role** - What is Daniel James Faucitt's current involvement? Is he aware of his beneficiary status? Is there a succession plan?

7. **Trust Income and Distributions** - Has the trust received income? Have distributions been made to beneficiaries?

8. **Related Party Transactions** - Given the trustee power to lend to related parties (Clause 6.15), have there been loans to or from Regima entities?

### Potential Issues

Based on the document analysis, several potential issues warrant further investigation:

1. **Asset Shifting** - The trust structure allows for easy transfer of assets between personal ownership and trust ownership, potentially to avoid creditors or obligations.

2. **Self-Dealing** - Trustees can lend to themselves or related entities, creating potential conflicts of interest.

3. **Lack of Oversight** - No required audits and minimal Master supervision create opportunities for misuse.

4. **Regima Connection** - The documented claim against RWD suggests the trust may be used to hold claims, assets, or interests related to the Regima business operations you have identified as problematic.

5. **Control Concentration** - Peter Faucitt's multiple roles (founder, trustee, beneficiary) and power to appoint trustees create a structure where he has complete control.
