- All tests use standard pytest framework

## Migration Guide

### For Database Sync Users

**Before:**
```python
# Old sync approach
sync_databases.py  # Manual execution, limited error handling
```

**After:**
```python
# New enhanced sync
from src.database_sync.enhanced_sync import EnhancedDatabaseSync, SyncCoordinator

# Single database sync with rollback
sync = EnhancedDatabaseSync(db_client, "database_name")
success, error = sync.execute_migration(migration_sql, "migration_name")

# Multi-database coordination
coordinator = SyncCoordinator()
results = coordinator.sync_all_databases(databases, migrations, dry_run=True)
```

### For Evidence Processing Users

**Before:**
```python
# Manual evidence processing
# - Manual entity extraction
# - Manual timeline integration
# - Manual compliance checking
```

**After:**
```python
# Automated evidence processing
from src.evidence_automation.evidence_pipeline import EvidenceProcessor

processor = EvidenceProcessor(evidence_dir="/path/to/evidence", output_dir="/path/to/output")

# Process single file
metadata = processor.process_evidence_file("/path/to/evidence.pdf")

# Process entire directory
all_metadata = processor.process_evidence_directory()

# Export results
processor.export_results()
```

## Testing

### Running New Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run database sync tests
pytest tests/unit/test_enhanced_database_sync.py -v

# Run evidence pipeline tests
pytest tests/unit/test_evidence_pipeline.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```
