   - Failure to protect trust assets
   - Allowing criminal activity

   - Trust can't even fund own assets
   - Relies on Daniel's payments
   - No legitimate revenue

### Impact on Daniel's Autonomy

1. **Victim of Crime**
   - Not incapacitated person
   - Competent business owner
   - Victim of organized fraud

2. **Business Ownership**
   - Operates UK companies
   - Funds operations
   - Manages customer relationships
   - **Proves competence for curatorship defense**

3. **Financial Sophistication**

   - **Demonstrates capacity**

4. **Claim to RWD**
   - Funded RWD operations
   - Protected RWD from collapse
   - Victim of hijacking
   - **Beneficial owner of RWD**

---

## 9. Curatorship Defense Strategy

### Use Criminal Scheme in Curatorship Hearing

**Argument:**

> "I am the victim of an organized criminal enterprise, not an incapacitated person requiring curatorship. The evidence shows:
>
> 1. **I operate legitimate UK businesses** - RegimA Zone Ltd and RegimA Dr H Ltd
>
> 2. **I funded RWD operations** - Paid Shopify bills for 28 months (R140K-R280K)
>
> 3. **I was defrauded** - Rynette sent R15M false invoices to my supplier to stop supply
>
> 4. **My customers were stolen** - Database extracted from 3 Shopify platforms
>
> 5. **My revenue was hijacked** - Customers redirected to competitor (March-July)
>
> 6. **I identified the fraud** - Recognized criminal scheme and gathered evidence
>
> 7. **I am taking legal action** - Filed criminal complaints and civil claims
>
> This demonstrates:
> - Business acumen (operating companies)
> - Financial competence (managing operations)
> - Legal sophistication (identifying fraud)
> - Decision-making capacity (pursuing remedies)
> - Entrepreneurial ability (building businesses)
>
> The curatorship application is part of this criminal scheme - an attempt to silence me and prevent me from pursuing legal action against the perpetrators. I am not incapacitated; I am a crime victim fighting back."

**Supporting Evidence:**
- UK company registration documents
- Shopify payment records
- R15M fraudulent invoices

- Revenue loss calculations
- Criminal complaints filed
- POPIA/GDPR complaints

**Effect:**
