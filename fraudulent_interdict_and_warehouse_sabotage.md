## Interdict Analysis: Which Companies Are Actually Interdicted?

### Hypothesis 1: J+P Companies Under Interdict

**If interdict targets J+P companies** (Jacqui + Peter, excluding Dan):

**Interdicted Companies** (J+P):
1. RegimA Medic (Pty) Ltd
2. RegimA International Skin Treatments (Pty) Ltd
3. Aymac International (Pty) Ltd
4. RegimA SpaZone (Pty) Ltd
5. CORPCLO 2065 (Pty) Ltd

**NOT Interdicted** (contain Dan as director):
- RegimA SA (D+P) ❌ Not interdicted
- RegimA Zone (D) ❌ Not interdicted
- RegimA Worldwide Distribution (D+J+P) ❌ Not interdicted

**Conclusion**: If this hypothesis is correct, **NONE of the Shopify platforms are under interdict**.

### Hypothesis 2: Specific Companies Under Interdict

**[To be confirmed from interdict documentation]**

**Recommendation**: Obtain copy of interdict to identify:
1. Which companies are actually interdicted
2. What activities are prohibited
3. Whether Shopify operations are mentioned
4. Legal basis for interdict

### Legal Implication: Fraudulent Scope Extension

**If Shopify companies are NOT interdicted**:
- Peter's warehouse instruction is **fraudulent**
- Misrepresented interdict scope to warehouse staff
- Used legal process for improper purpose (sabotage)
- Criminal fraud + abuse of process

**If Shopify companies ARE interdicted**:
- Peter is co-director of RegimA SA (interdicted his own company?)
- Breach of fiduciary duty (sabotaging own company)
- Still criminal (sabotaging RegimA Zone where he has no interest)

**Either way**: Peter's conduct is criminal and civilly actionable.

## Interdict Abuse Pattern

### Pattern Analysis

**Step 1**: Obtain interdict against Companies X, Y, Z (J+P companies)

**Step 2**: Misrepresent interdict scope to warehouse staff

**Step 3**: Instruct warehouse to stop Shopify supply (Companies A, B, C - NOT interdicted)

**Step 4**: Shopify operations fail due to unfulfilled orders

**Step 5**: Appropriate failed operations at reduced value

**Criminal Pattern**: Systematic abuse of legal process for business appropriation

### Consciousness of Guilt

**Why use interdict fraudulently?**
- Because Peter has **no legitimate claim** to Shopify operations
- RegimA Zone is Dan-only (Peter has NO interest)
- RegimA SA is D+P (Peter would harm his own company)
- RWD is D+J+P (requires all three directors' consent)
