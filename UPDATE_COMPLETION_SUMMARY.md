## Key Facts Now Documented Across All Files

### 1. Rynette Farrar
- Position: Bookkeeper (NOT director/shareholder)
- Control: SOLE access to all accounts (illegal)
- Authority: NONE for such control
- Actions: Locked out legitimate parties

### 2. The R10 Million Factor
- Danie Bantjies owes BOTH Peter & Jacqui
- Due: April 2026
- Impact: They should cooperate, not fight
- Risk: Conflict helps debtors/controllers

### 3. Corrected Narratives
- Peter CANNOT steal (no access)
- Jacqui does NOT do finance
- Daniel's R500k was legitimate director's loan
- R12M transfer could only be by Rynette

### 4. Timeline Clarity
- May 29: Son registers domain
- June 7: Financial control seized
- Sept 11: R12M transferred
- April 2026: R10M due

### 5. The Real Story
- Bookkeeper seized unauthorized control
- Co-creditors manipulated into fighting
- Assets being drained while distracted
- Third parties benefit from conflict

## Impact of Updates

### Legal Implications Now Clear
1. Criminal fraud by Rynette (exceeding authority)
2. Peter is victim, not perpetrator
3. Jacqui has no financial wrongdoing
4. Conflict serves third-party interests

### Financial Reality Documented
1. Only Rynette can move money
2. R12M already transferred
3. R10M at risk if conflict continues
4. Customer base being stolen

### Strategic Path Forward
1. Remove unauthorized access
2. Unite co-creditors
3. Recover stolen assets
4. Collect R10M debt
5. Pursue criminal charges

## Summary

All relevant documents have been updated with:
- Evidence-based facts only
- Corrected false narratives  
- Critical context about unauthorized control
- R10M debt creating unified interests
- Clear explanation of who benefits from conflict

The case documentation now accurately reflects that this is not a legitimate dispute between Peter and Jacqui, but rather a situation where:
1. A bookkeeper illegally controls all finances
2. Co-creditors are fighting instead of cooperating
3. Third parties benefit while assets disappear
4. The real victims are being distracted by manufactured conflict
