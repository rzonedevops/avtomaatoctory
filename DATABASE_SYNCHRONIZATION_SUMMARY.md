5. **Production Deployment**: Successfully merged to main branch

#### Performance Indexes Implemented

The following strategic indexes were successfully deployed to optimize query performance:

**Entity Management**
- `idx_entities_entity_type` - Optimizes entity type filtering and classification queries

**Event Processing**
- `idx_events_event_type` - Enhances event categorization and filtering
- `idx_events_date` - Accelerates temporal queries and timeline analysis

**Relationship Analysis**
- `idx_relationships_source_entity` - Optimizes relationship traversal from source entities
- `idx_relationships_target_entity` - Enhances relationship queries to target entities
- `idx_relationships_relationship_type` - Improves relationship type filtering and analysis

**Evidence Management**
- `idx_evidence_evidence_type` - Streamlines evidence categorization queries
- `idx_evidence_classification_level` - Optimizes security and access control queries

#### Database Tables Confirmed

All four core tables are operational in the Neon database:

| Table Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `entities` | BASE TABLE | Person, organization, and entity management |
| `events` | BASE TABLE | Timeline events and temporal data |
| `relationships` | BASE TABLE | Network connections and relationship mapping |
| `evidence` | BASE TABLE | Evidence items and chain of custody tracking |

### Supabase Integration
