## STRATEGIC NARRATIVE

**What Really Happened in 2025:**

RWD underwent a **comprehensive business transformation** in 2025, characterized by three major strategic shifts:

1. **Technology-Led Future**: The company invested heavily in digital infrastructure (R4.3M), positioning for e-commerce growth and operational efficiency. This represents a bet on digital channels to replace traditional sales methods.

2. **Leaner Operations**: Aggressive cost management reduced purchases by 30% and sales force by 69%, while maintaining core operations. This suggests a move toward a more automated, efficient business model.

3. **Working Capital Optimization**: The company improved collections dramatically while extending payment terms to suppliers, effectively using trade credit to finance the technology transformation.

**The Bottom Line**: RWD transformed from a traditional distribution company to a technology-enabled operation in 2025, achieving profitability through operational efficiency rather than revenue growth. The success of this transformation will depend on whether the technology investments generate future revenue growth to justify the current expenditure.

---

## CONCLUSION

RWD achieved a remarkable financial turnaround, moving from a loss position to profitability despite declining revenues. The key driver was aggressive cost management, particularly in purchases (30% reduction). However, the company faces challenges with revenue growth and has made significant technology investments that need to generate returns. The reduction in sales representatives may impact future revenue generation and requires close monitoring.

**Overall Performance Grade: B+** - Strong cost management and profitability improvement, but revenue decline and high technology spending require attention.
