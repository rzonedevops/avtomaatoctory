## Critical Inter-Company Transactions

### Interest Payment Flow
- **Date**: 2020-02-28
- **Transaction**: Strategic Logistics pays R414,334.09 interest to RegimA Skin Treatments
- **Significance**: Demonstrates the loan relationship and interest burden on SLG

### Production Cost Allocations
- **Date**: 2020-02-20

## Red Flags Identified

1. **Massive Inter-Company Debt**: SLG owes RST R13M, creating artificial profit shifting
2. **Cost Reallocation Patterns**: Significant admin fee reallocations that may obscure true profitability
3. **Different Financial Year-Ends**: Creates complexity and potential for manipulation
4. **Villa Via Capital Structure**: R22.8M members loan suggests capital extraction
