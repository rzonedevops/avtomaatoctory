**From:** Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>  
**To:** kent@regima.zone <kent@regima.zone>  
**Subject:** URGENT: MANDATORY COMPLIANCE DIRECTIVE - PERSONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY WARNING

## RE: ILLEGAL INSTRUCTIONS - PERSONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY

**THIS IS NOT A WORKPLACE DISPUTE. THIS IS A LEGAL COMPLIANCE MATTER.**

It has come to my attention that employees have been instructed to:

- Stop using Shopify for customer orders
- Use unauthorized domains for company business
- Process customer data outside approved systems

**LEGAL WARNING: These instructions are ILLEGAL and expose YOU to personal criminal prosecution.**

## YOUR PERSONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY

Under the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI):

- **Unauthorized access to customer data: 10 years imprisonment**
- **Processing data outside approved systems: R10 million fine**
- **Each violation is a separate criminal offense**
- **"Following orders" is NOT a legal defence**

## THE LEGAL FACTS

1. **Customer data belongs to RegimA Distribution companies** - not RegimA Skin Treatments
2. **RegimA Skin Treatments employees are unauthorized third parties** to this data
3. **Only Shopify has legal authorization** to process customer information
4. **Alternative domains lack required security** and compliance measures

## MANDATORY DIRECTIVE - EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

**YOU MUST:**
- Process ALL orders through Shopify only
- Use ONLY official company domains
- Report any requests to violate this directive

**YOU MUST NOT:**
- Access customer data on unauthorized systems
- Use personal or alternative domains
- Follow instructions that violate POPI

## CRITICAL: CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS

If ANYONE (regardless of position) instructs you to:
- Access customer data outside Shopify
- Use unauthorized domains
- Bypass security protocols

**YOUR LEGAL OBLIGATION:**
1. Refuse the instruction
2. Request written authorization acknowledging criminal liability
3. Report immediately to inforegulator.org.za
4. You are legally protected for refusing illegal orders

## DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT

I am aware that alternative instructions have been given. For your protection:
- Document any pressure to violate this directive
- Save all emails/messages instructing illegal access
- Report threats or intimidation immediately

## YOUR RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS

- **Refusing illegal orders is your RIGHT**
- **Dismissal for legal compliance = automatic unfair dismissal**
- **Criminal law supersedes employment instructions**
- **The company cannot indemnify criminal acts**

## THE SIMPLE TEST

Ask yourself: "Would I do this with my own customer data?"
- Share it with random companies? NO
- Put it on someone's personal domain? NO
- Process it outside secure systems? NO

**Then you cannot do it with our customers' data.**

## PERSONAL CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE

**For You:**
- Criminal prosecution
- Personal fines up to R10 million
- Prison sentence up to 10 years
- Permanent criminal record
- Career destruction

**Not for the person giving illegal instructions - for YOU**

## CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

Please confirm receipt and understanding by responding: "I understand my personal criminal liability and will comply with legal requirements."

Non-response will be deemed acceptance of personal liability for any violations.

## REMEMBER

- Your fingerprints are on the keyboard
- Your login is in the system
- Your actions are logged
- Your criminal liability is personal
- Your future depends on your choices

**This directive supersedes ALL contrary instructions regardless of source.**

Anyone suggesting this is merely an internal dispute is not supported by evidence you about your personal criminal exposure.

**IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE REQUIRED**

Daniel Faucitt  
CIO
