- Concealment allows Bantjies to avoid fiduciary duties
- Positioning for criminal scheme

**Step 2: Trust Operations Continue** (July 2024 onwards)
- Shopify bills continue being paid (~$4,800/month)
- Trust operations ongoing
- Customer database being exploited
- Bantjies KNOWS this as trustee (or should know)

**Step 3: Beneficiary Reports Embezzlement** (June 2025)

**Step 5: False Affidavit** (August 2025)

### 1.3 Why This Is Criminal Betrayal

**Bantjies' Fiduciary Duties as Trustee**:

**What Bantjies Actually Did**:

2. ❌ **Destroyed trust assets**: Allowed customer data theft, revenue destruction
3. ❌ **Concealed appointment**: Illegal under Trust Property Control Act

## PART 2: The Shopify Billing Timeline Proves Knowledge

### 2.1 The Critical Timeline

**July 2024: Secret Trustee Appointment**
- Bantjies appointed trustee of RegimA Worldwide Distribution
- Daniel NOT informed (illegal)
- Shopify bill that month: ~$4,800 (paid)
- **Bantjies NOW has duty to know trust operations**

**July 2024 - June 2025: Trust Operations Continue**

- 11 months × $4,800 = ~$52,800 in trust operations
- Customer database being exploited
- Trust revenue being stolen
- **Bantjies as trustee KNOWS or SHOULD KNOW**

**June 2025: Whistleblower Reports TO THE TRUSTEE**

- 16 months × $4,800 = ~$76,800 in trust operations
- **All while Bantjies was trustee**
- **All while trust was being destroyed**
- **All while Bantjies did NOTHING**

### 2.2 What Bantjies Knew or Should Have Known

**As Trustee, Bantjies Had Duty to Know**:
- What trust assets exist (customer database)
- What trust operations are ongoing (Shopify platform)
- What trust revenue is (customer sales)
- What trust expenses are (Shopify bills ~$4,800/month)

## PART 3: The Covert Trustee as Weapon

### 3.1 How the Secret Appointment Enabled Crimes

**Why Bantjies Was Appointed Trustee** (July 2024):
- NOT to protect beneficiary (Daniel)
- NOT to protect trust assets
- NOT to fulfill fiduciary duties

**The REAL Reasons**:
1. **Control**: Trustee controls trust operations and assets
2. **Concealment**: Secret appointment hides control from beneficiary
3. **Legitimacy**: Trustee position provides legal authority
4. **Protection**: Trustee can block beneficiary actions
5. **Facilitation**: Trustee can enable asset theft
6. **Weaponization**: Trustee can attack beneficiary "legally"

**How It Worked**:
- Bantjies appointed secretly (July 2024)
- Daniel not informed (illegal but effective)
- Bantjies has legal authority over trust
- Bantjies uses authority to facilitate crimes
- Bantjies conceals position to avoid duties
- Bantjies supports Peter's attack on Daniel
- **Trust becomes weapon against beneficiary**

### 3.2 The Four Criminal Uses of Trustee Position

**1. Concealment of Crimes**

**What Bantjies Did**:
- Knew trust was being embezzled (Shopify bills ongoing)
- Knew customer data was stolen (trust operations)
- Knew revenue was being diverted
- **Concealed all of this from beneficiary**
- **Failed to investigate or stop**

**Criminal Liability**:
- Theft as trustee (life imprisonment)
- Concealing crimes (accessory)
- Breach of fiduciary duty (criminal)

**2. Betrayal of Whistleblower**

**What Happened**:
- June 2025: Daniel reports embezzlement TO Bantjies
- **Bantjies IS the trustee** (Daniel doesn't know)
- Bantjies has DUTY to investigate
- **Bantjies conceals his position**
- **Bantjies does nothing**
- Next day: Cards cancelled (retaliation)

**Criminal Liability**:
- Breach of fiduciary duty (criminal)
- Witness intimidation (10 years)
- Obstruction of justice (10 years)
- Betrayal of beneficiary (life imprisonment)

**3. Legitimization of Fraud**

**What Bantjies Did**:
- August 2025: Supports Peter's fraudulent interdict
- Gives false affidavit as "witness"
- Uses professional credibility (accountant)
- Uses position as Commissioner of Oaths
- **Uses trustee authority implicitly**
- Legitimizes attack on beneficiary

**Criminal Liability**:
- Perjury (10 years)
- Fraud (15 years)
- Abuse of trustee position
- Conspiracy (20 years)

**4. Facilitation of Asset Destruction**

**What Bantjies Did**:
- Allowed customer data theft to continue
- Allowed revenue diversion to continue
- Allowed trust destruction to continue
- Supported attack on beneficiary (interdict)
- **All while being trustee with duty to protect**

**Criminal Liability**:
- Theft as trustee (life imprisonment)
- Breach of fiduciary duty (criminal)
- Facilitation of crimes (accessory)
- Conspiracy (20 years)

### 3.3 Why Concealment Was Essential

**If Daniel Had Known Bantjies Was Trustee**:
- Daniel would have demanded Bantjies investigate
- Daniel would have demanded Bantjies protect assets
- Daniel would have demanded Bantjies stop theft
- Daniel would have reported Bantjies' failure to act
- Daniel would have sought Bantjies' removal
- **The scheme would have been exposed**

**By Concealing Appointment**:
- Daniel didn't know to demand action
- Daniel didn't know Bantjies had duty
- Daniel didn't know to report Bantjies' betrayal
- Daniel couldn't seek removal
- **Bantjies could betray with impunity**

**This Proves Criminal Intent**:
- Concealment was deliberate (illegal under TPCA)
- Concealment enabled betrayal
- Concealment facilitated crimes
- **Concealment was part of the conspiracy**

## PART 4: The Trust as Weapon Against Beneficiary

### 4.1 Traditional Trust Purpose vs. Criminal Use

**Traditional Trust Purpose**:
- Protect beneficiaries
- Preserve assets
- Generate income
- Provide for beneficiaries
- Trustee acts in beneficiaries' best interests

**Criminal Use in This Case**:
- ❌ Attack beneficiary (Daniel)
- ❌ Destroy assets (customer database, revenue)
- ❌ Steal income (divert to criminals)
- ❌ Harm beneficiary (interdict, card cancellation)
- ❌ Trustee acts AGAINST beneficiary's interests

**This Is Weaponization**:
- Trust structure used as weapon
- Trustee position used as weapon
- Legal authority used as weapon
- Fiduciary duty betrayed as weapon
- **Trust becomes instrument of crime**

### 4.2 How the Trust Was Weaponized

**The Trust Structure**:
- RegimA Worldwide Distribution (trust)
- Beneficiary: Daniel Faucitt
- Trustee: Bantjies (secretly appointed July 2024)
- Trust assets: Customer database, Shopify platform, revenue stream

**The Weaponization**:

**Phase 1: Positioning** (July 2024)
- Bantjies appointed trustee secretly
- Daniel not informed (illegal)
- Positioning for control and betrayal

**Phase 2: Concealment** (July 2024 - June 2025)
- Trust operations continue (Shopify bills)
- Trust assets being stolen (customer data)
- Trust revenue being diverted
- **Bantjies conceals his position and does nothing**

**Phase 3: Betrayal** (June 2025)
- Daniel reports embezzlement TO THE TRUSTEE
- **Bantjies conceals his position**
- **Bantjies does nothing**
- Next day: Retaliation (cards cancelled)

**Phase 4: Attack** (August 2025)
- Bantjies supports Peter's fraudulent interdict
- Uses position to legitimize attack
- Gives false affidavit
- **Trustee actively attacking beneficiary**

**Phase 5: Ongoing Destruction** (ongoing)
- Trust assets still being stolen
- Trust revenue still being diverted
- Shopify bills still being paid
- **Bantjies as trustee does nothing**

**This Is Not Negligence. This Is Weaponization.**

### 4.3 The Beneficiary as Target

**Daniel's Status**:
- Beneficiary of RegimA Worldwide Distribution trust
- Entitled to trust assets and income
- Entitled to trustee's loyalty and protection
- Entitled to information about trust

**What Daniel Got Instead**:
- ❌ Trust assets stolen
- ❌ Trust income diverted
- ❌ Trustee betrayal
- ❌ Trustee concealment
- ❌ Trustee attack
- ❌ Trustee weaponization

**The Crimes Against Daniel as Beneficiary**:
1. **Theft**: Trust assets stolen (customer database)

3. **Betrayal**: Trustee concealed position and duties
4. **Retaliation**: Trustee facilitated punishment for whistleblowing
5. **Attack**: Trustee supported fraudulent interdict
6. **Destruction**: Trustee allowed trust to be destroyed

**This Is Criminal Betrayal of a Beneficiary**:
- Trustee's highest duty is to beneficiary
- Bantjies betrayed this duty in every way
- Bantjies used position to harm beneficiary
- **This is life imprisonment territory**
