## Document Context

This comprehensive legal compliance guide was originally created by Daniel Faucitt to summarize all legal frameworks and risks when deciding how to structure IT services. The document represents months of legal research and internalization of thousands of pages of South African law, specifically addressing AI-era compliance challenges.

## Legislative Timeline and Evolution

### Reverse Chronological Overview

**2021** - POPI Act (comprehensive data protection)  
**2021** - Cybercrimes Act (modern digital threats)  
**2017** - FICA Amendment (enhanced due diligence)  
**2012** - Tax Administration Act (SARS modernization)  
**2011** - CPA (comprehensive consumer rights)  
**2008** - Companies Act (corporate governance)  
**2007** - NCA (consumer credit protection)  
**2003** - RICA (communications privacy)  
**2002** - ECTA (digital commerce enablement)  
**2001** - PAIA (transparency foundation)  
**2001** - FICA (financial sector protection)  
**1999** - Competition Act (foundational market regulation)  
**1997** - Counterfeit Goods Act (enforcement mechanisms)

### Key Observations

The legislative framework demonstrates a **28-year evolution** from basic trademark protection to comprehensive AI-era compliance. Recent acceleration with POPI and Cybercrimes Act specifically addresses modern AI and digital risks. The framework shows layered compliance where newer laws build on older frameworks, with only recent laws (2021) specifically contemplating AI challenges. Multiple overlapping laws create a comprehensive anti-fraud framework.

## Executive Summary

### Critical AI Fraud Risks and Legal Requirements
