# ReZonance Financial Analysis Summary

## Outstanding Debt Analysis

The financial records reveal a substantial outstanding debt of **R1,035,361.34** as of February 28, 2023. This amount represents the cumulative result of IT service billing that began in 2017 and continued through the analysis period. The debt has proven remarkably persistent despite significant payment efforts during 2022-2023.

## Service Billing Pattern Analysis

The billing pattern shows a dramatic escalation from modest monthly charges to substantial cumulative amounts. Initial services in June 2017 began with Google GSuite at approximately R250.80 monthly. However, by September 2017, monthly billing had escalated to include multiple enterprise-level services including Office 365 Enterprise E5, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and various hosting services.

The most significant billing period occurred between September and December 2017, where cumulative balances exceeded R280,000. This represents an extraordinary escalation in service consumption that warrants investigation. The billing includes consistent 10% markup charges on all services, suggesting ReZonance operated as a reseller rather than direct service provider.

## Payment History and Effectiveness

During the 2022-2023 period, RegimA Skin Treatments made substantial payments totaling **R470,000**. The payment pattern shows initial payments of R10,000 and R30,000 in July 2022, followed by consistent R50,000 monthly payments from August 2022 through February 2023. This structured payment schedule suggests either a formal payment arrangement or court-ordered settlement.

Despite these substantial payments, the outstanding balance actually increased from the opening balance of R971,587.93 to the closing balance of R1,035,361.34. This indicates that additional charges, interest, or penalties were being applied during the payment period at a rate exceeding the payment amounts.

## Service Categories and Cost Structure

The financial records reveal a comprehensive IT service portfolio including productivity software (Google GSuite, Office 365), creative tools (Adobe Creative Cloud), communication platforms (Slack), cloud storage (DropBox), hosting services, and enterprise applications (Microsoft Dynamics, Docebo Learning Portal). The consistent 10% markup on all services indicates ReZonance's role as an IT service aggregator.

The cost structure suggests either legitimate enterprise-level IT infrastructure requirements or potential overbilling. The rapid escalation from basic email services to comprehensive enterprise solutions within months raises questions about the necessity and authorization of such extensive service expansion.

## Accounting Irregularities

The March 2022 financial records show multiple journal adjustments totaling over R100,000, all referenced as "wrong period" entries. These adjustments were subsequently reversed through payment entries, suggesting either systematic accounting errors or deliberate manipulation of financial records. Such large-scale period adjustments require investigation to determine their legitimacy.

## Inter-company Relationship Implications

The financial relationship between ReZonance and RegimA Skin Treatments appears to be part of a broader network of related entities including Strategic Logistics Group, Regima Worldwide, Villa Via, and others. The complex ownership structure and inter-company transactions suggest potential transfer pricing issues or profit-shifting mechanisms that may affect the legitimacy of the outstanding debt.

## Compliance and Legal Risks

The outstanding debt has created cascading compliance risks. The inability to resolve the financial dispute has led to non-filing of statutory returns for related companies, creating deregistration risks. The involvement of deceased director Kayla Pretorius's estate adds additional complexity, as proper estate representation is required for debt resolution and company governance.

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

The financial analysis reveals several areas requiring detailed investigation. The dramatic billing escalation in 2017 needs verification against actual service delivery and authorization. The payment allocation discrepancies mentioned in the correspondence require reconciliation to determine if payments were properly credited. The accounting adjustments in March 2022 need detailed review to assess their legitimacy and impact on the debt calculation.

The complex inter-company relationships within the Regima Group require analysis to determine if the ReZonance debt represents legitimate commercial obligations or part of a broader scheme involving transfer pricing manipulation or profit-shifting. The estate complications require legal resolution to enable proper debt settlement and company governance restoration.
