## PART 1: Understanding the Criminal Offences

### 1.1 This Is NOT a Data Breach Report

**Critical Distinction**:
- **Data breach**: Accidental or negligent exposure of data
- **Data theft**: Deliberate, criminal taking of data for gain
- **This case**: Organized criminal theft, not a breach

**Why This Matters**:
- Different ICO team (Criminal Investigations Team)
- Different legal framework (criminal prosecution, not regulatory)
- Different penalties (unlimited fines + imprisonment)
- Different urgency (ongoing crime, not past incident)

### 1.2 Criminal Offences Under Data Protection Act 2018

#### Section 170: Unlawfully Obtaining Personal Data

**The Offence**:
A person commits an offence if they knowingly or recklessly obtain or disclose personal data without the consent of the controller.

2. Without consent of the data controller
3. Knowingly or recklessly
4. No lawful authority

**In This Case**:
- Peter Faucitt obtained entire customer database
- Without consent of legitimate controller (UK company)
- Knowingly (deliberate extraction)
- No lawful authority (theft for commercial gain)

**Penalty**: Unlimited fine + imprisonment

#### Section 171: Re-identification of De-identified Data

**The Offence**:
A person commits an offence if they knowingly or recklessly re-identify information that is de-identified personal data without the consent of the controller.

**In This Case** (if applicable):
- If customer data was pseudonymized or aggregated
- Defendants re-identified individuals
- For direct marketing purposes

**Penalty**: Unlimited fine + imprisonment

#### Section 173: Alteration of Personal Data to Prevent Disclosure

**The Offence**:
A person commits an offence if they alter, deface, block, erase, destroy, or conceal information with the intention of preventing disclosure following an information notice.

**In This Case**:
- May 22, 2025: Shopify audit trails deleted
- 7 days after data theft exposed
- Deliberate evidence destruction
- To prevent disclosure of criminal acts

**Penalty**: Unlimited fine + imprisonment

#### Section 148: Destroying or Falsifying Information

**Additional Offence**:
Destroying or falsifying documents or information with intent to prevent production under an information notice.

**In This Case**:
- Systematic deletion of access logs
- Removal of download records
- Obstruction of investigation

**Penalty**: Unlimited fine + imprisonment

### 1.3 Why Criminal Prosecution Is Appropriate

**Factors Supporting Criminal Prosecution**:
1. **Deliberate criminal act** (not negligence)
2. **Commercial gain** (profit motive)
3. **Large scale** (9 years of data, thousands of individuals)
4. **UK/EU citizens** (protected data subjects)
5. **Evidence destruction** (consciousness of guilt)
6. **Part of organized crime** (murder-related conspiracy)
7. **Ongoing harm** (continued exploitation)
8. **Professional criminals** (lawyers, accountants involved)
9. **Public interest** (deterrence, GDPR integrity)
10. **International crime** (UK reputation at stake)

- ❌ No lawful basis (Article 6)
- ❌ Theft is inherently unfair
- ❌ Secret extraction, no transparency

**Purpose Limitation**:
- ❌ Used for unauthorized purposes (customer diversion)

**Data Minimization**:
- ❌ Took entire database (everything)
- ❌ No assessment of necessity

**Accuracy**:

- ❌ No deletion policy

**Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)**:

### 10.2 Why Regulatory Action Is Insufficient

**Criminal Prosecution Necessary Because**:

**1. Deliberate Crime, Not Negligence**:

**2. Deterrence Requires Criminal Penalties**:
- Fines alone insufficient deterrent
- Imprisonment necessary
- Asset confiscation required
- Director disqualification needed

**3. Ongoing Crime**:
- Not a past incident
- Continuing exploitation
- Evidence destruction ongoing
- Immediate intervention required

**4. International Enforcement**:
- Regulatory action limited to UK
- Criminal prosecution enables INTERPOL
- Extradition available
- Worldwide asset recovery

**5. Public Confidence**:
- Public expects criminal prosecution for theft
- GDPR credibility depends on enforcement
- Regulatory action seen as insufficient
- Criminal conviction necessary for justice
