## **The Cookie Jar Theft Story**

Imagine you have **4 cookie jars** in your house, and your family members help take care of them. But one sneaky family member figured out how to steal cookies and make it look like someone else ate them!

---

## **üë• The Players**

**Dan** = The hardworking family member who owns 2 of the cookie jars
**Pete** = The sneaky family member who helps with 3 cookie jars but doesn't own any
**The Cookie Jars** = 4 different companies with money in them

---

## **üç™ How the Cookie Theft Works**

### **Step 1: Steal the Cookies (Asset Stripping)**
- Pete takes **ZAR 5.2 million worth of cookies** from Dan's first jar (SLG)
- He says "Oops, the cookies just disappeared!" 
- He also forces Dan's jar to "sell" cookies to other jars for almost nothing
- **Simple version**: Pete steals Dan's stuff and pretends it just vanished

### **Step 2: Make New Cookies Cheap (Profit Generation)**  
- Pete puts the stolen cookies into his friend's jar (RST)
- Now his friend's jar looks full of cookies they "made" for almost no cost
- They sell these cookies for full price and make lots of money
- **Simple version**: Pete's friends get rich selling Dan's stolen cookies

### **Step 3: Dump All the Mess (Expense Dumping)**
- Pete takes ALL the bills for cookie-making (electricity, workers, equipment)
- He dumps ALL these bills into Dan's second jar (RWD) 
- Dan's second jar has to pay for EVERYTHING even though it has no workers!
- **Simple version**: Dan pays all the bills while Pete's friends pay nothing

### **Step 4: Take the Profits (Final Extraction)**
- Pete's friend's jar (RST) made lots of money from the stolen cookies
- Pete charges his friend's jar "rent" to keep the cookies - **86% of all profits!**
- Pete personally gets **ZAR 4+ million** in his own pocket
- **Simple version**: Pete takes almost all the money for himself

## **üé≠ How Pete Hides the Theft**

### **The "Group" Trick**
- Pete tells everyone that 3 jars (SLG, RST, RWD) are "one big group"
- But he hides his own jar (VVA) so nobody sees him taking the money
- It's like saying "we're all sharing cookies" but secretly keeping your own jar hidden
- **Simple version**: Pete pretends some jars share everything while hiding his own

### **The Blame Game**
- When people notice Dan's jars are empty, Pete says: "Dan wasted money on computer stuff!"
- But the truth is: Dan's jar with no workers pays ALL the computer bills
- Pete's friend's jar has ALL the workers but pays almost NO computer bills
- **Simple version**: Pete blames Dan for being poor after Pete stole from him

### **The Complaint Trick**
- Pete complains to the teacher (Bantjes): "Our group lost money because Dan is bad with money!"
- But Pete just put **ZAR 4+ million** in his own pocket from that same "group"
- **Simple version**: Pete steals your lunch money then complains you're hungry

- But he also benefits from his friends' jars (because he gets money from them)
- **Simple version**: Pete is like a babysitter who can decide what happens to your toys

### **The Voting Trick**
- When decisions need to be made about Dan's jars, Pete gets a vote
- Pete always votes to help his friends and hurt Dan
- Dan can't stop him because Pete has voting power
- **Simple version**: Pete gets to vote on what happens to your stuff, and he always votes against you

## **üö® Why This is Really Bad**

### **It's Stealing**
- Taking ZAR 5.2 million in "cookies" that just "disappeared"
- Moving money from Dan's jars to Pete's friends' jars
- Pete putting ZAR 4+ million directly in his own pocket

### **It's Lying**
- Pretending the jars are "one group" when they're not
- Blaming Dan for problems Pete created
- Hiding where the money really went

## **üéØ The Simple Truth**

**What Pete Did**: Used his position helping manage Dan's money to systematically steal it and give it to his friends, while taking millions for himself and then blaming Dan for the missing money.

**How Much**: At least ZAR 12+ million per month, possibly hundreds of millions over years.

**How He Hid It**: Pretended some companies were "one group" while hiding his own, blamed Dan for expenses Pete created, and complained about losses while personally getting rich.

**Why It Worked**: Pete had voting power over Dan's companies but also benefited from competing companies, creating a perfect conflict of interest that let him systematically steal.

**The Bottom Line**: Pete figured out how to be the fox guarding the henhouse, and he ate all the chickens while blaming the farmer for not feeding them properly.

## **üç™ Cookie Jar Summary**

- **Dan's Jar #1 (SLG)**: Had ZAR 5.2M in cookies stolen, forced to sell remaining cookies for almost nothing
- **Pete's Friend's Jar (RST)**: Got rich selling Dan's stolen cookies while paying almost no expenses  
- **Dan's Jar #2 (RWD)**: Forced to pay ALL the bills despite having no workers to make cookies
- **Pete's Hidden Jar (VVA)**: Where Pete hides and takes ZAR 4+ million for himself through "rent"

**Result**: Dan's jars are empty and in debt, Pete's friends are rich, and Pete personally got ZAR 4+ million while complaining that Dan is bad with money.

**This is why it's called embezzlement**: Pete was trusted to help manage the money, but instead he systematically stole it for himself and his friends while making it look like Dan's fault.

**The Scary Part**: If Pete stole ZAR 12+ million in just one month, and nobody knows how long this has been happening, the total theft could be **hundreds of millions of rand** - making this one of the biggest embezzlement schemes in South African history.
