# EVIDENCE REQUIRED TO PROSECUTE THE CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY
## Case 2025-137857: Analysis for Criminal Prosecution & Civil Damages

### Report Date: Monday, October 6, 2025
### Classification: URGENT - Criminal Prosecution Strategy

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report has been fundamentally revised. Its original purpose was to analyze the evidence needed to defend against the Faucitt interdict. It now serves as a blueprint for **prosecuting the criminal conspiracy** orchestrated by Peter Faucitt and his accomplices. The focus has shifted from defense to offense. The evidence gathered will be used to secure criminal convictions for perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness intimidation, and to win a civil suit for malicious prosecution.

### Key Finding
The evidence is overwhelming. The combination of the perjured first interdict and the malicious second interdict provides irrefutable proof of a criminal conspiracy to abuse the justice system to conceal murder and silence a witness.

## 1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR PROSECUTION

### 1.1 Key Criminal Charges to Pursue

1.  **Defeating/Obstructing the Course of Justice**: The entire campaign, from the first lie to the latest act of intimidation.
2.  **Perjury**: In the sworn affidavits of both the first and second interdict applications.
3.  **Witness Intimidation**: Specifically, the second interdict and the forced medical testing scheme.
4.  **Fraud**: On the court, by obtaining legal orders through deceit.

### 1.2 Grounds for Civil Claim: Malicious Prosecution

All four elements are now firmly established:
1.  **Lack of Reasonable Cause**: Proven by the June 10 email and the bank statements disproving the second interdict's claims.
2.  **Malice**: Proven by the retaliatory pattern and the use of a discrediting tactic (medical testing) instead of addressing the evidence.
3.  **Termination in Plaintiff's Favor**: The first interdict is void ab initio, and the second is demonstrably malicious.
4.  **Damages**: Legal costs, reputational harm, and severe emotional distress inflicted upon Daniel Faucitt.

## 2. ANALYSIS OF PETER FAUCITT'S ACTIONS AS EVIDENCE OF CRIME

### 2.1 The First Interdict: The Act of Perjury

**Peter's Action**: Filing an interdict based on financial misconduct claims while concealing his prior knowledge (since June 10) of the true context (murder, his own theft).

**Evidence Proving the Crime**:
1.  **The June 10, 2025 Email**: Irrefutable proof of Peter's and Danie Bantjes's prior knowledge. This is the smoking gun for the perjury charge.
2.  **The ENS Africa Withdrawal Letter**: Expert corroboration from a top-tier law firm that a fraud was committed on the court, forcing their withdrawal.
3.  **The Interdict Affidavits**: The perjured documents themselves, which contain the material falsehoods.

### 2.2 The Second Interdict: The Act of Witness Intimidation

**Peter's Action**: Filing a second interdict with fabricated claims of gambling/pornography addiction to force invasive medical testing.

**Evidence Proving the Crime**:
1.  **The Bank Statements**: Documentary proof that the allegations are false and the expenses are legitimate business costs. This proves malice.
2.  **The Timing of the Application**: Filed immediately after the first conspiracy began to unravel, demonstrating a retaliatory and desperate motive.
3.  **The Nature of the Relief Sought**: Forced medical testing is not a remedy for financial disputes; it is a classic tactic to harass, humiliate, and discredit a witness.

## 4. WITNESS STRATEGY FOR PROSECUTION

### 4.1 Key Witnesses for the State

1.  **Daniel Faucitt**: The primary witness and victim. His testimony will establish the entire narrative.
2.  **A Representative from ENS Africa**: Can be subpoenaed to testify as to the reasons for their withdrawal, confirming they discovered the fraud.
3.  **IT Service Providers**: To confirm the legitimacy of the R8.8M in IT expenses, further proving the first interdict was baseless.
4.  **A Forensic Accountant**: To present the analysis of Daniel's bank statements, proving the second interdict's claims are false.

### 4.2 Hostile Witnesses

1.  **Danie Bantjes (Accountant)**: As a co-conspirator in the perjury, he will be treated as a hostile witness. His testimony can be dismantled using the June 10 email.

## 5. STRATEGIC APPROACH TO PROSECUTION & CIVIL ACTION

### 5.1 Criminal Prosecution

**Focus**: Secure convictions for defeating the ends of justice, perjury, and witness intimidation.
-   **Lead Charge**: Defeating the ends of justice, as it encompasses the entire criminal enterprise.
-   **Action**: Compile a comprehensive evidence docket for the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).

### 5.2 Civil Action for Malicious Prosecution

**Focus**: Obtain significant financial damages for the harm caused to Daniel Faucitt.
-   **Action**: File a civil summons against Peter Faucitt concurrently with the criminal proceedings.
-   **Damages**: Claim for legal costs, reputational damage, and punitive damages for the malicious abuse of the court system.

## 6. CONCLUSION

The objective is no longer to "set aside" the interdicts. The interdicts are legal nullities, void from the moment they were conceived in fraud. The objective now is to use them as the primary evidence in a criminal prosecution.

### Evidence Strength Assessment
-   **Perjury**: Overwhelming. The documentary evidence is conclusive.
-   **Witness Intimidation**: Extremely strong. The motive and method are clear.
-   **Malicious Prosecution**: All elements are met and supported by powerful evidence.

This case represents a critical test of the justice system's ability to protect itself and those who turn to it for protection. The evidence required is not to defend against a lawsuit, but to prosecute a crime.
