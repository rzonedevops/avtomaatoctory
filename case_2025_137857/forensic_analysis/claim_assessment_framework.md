# CLAIM PRIORITY & STRENGTH ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK (REVISED)
## Forensic Analysis Methodology for Criminal & Civil Claims

### Framework Version: 2.0
### Date: Monday, October 6, 2025
### Case Reference: 2025-137857

---

## 1. OVERVIEW: SHIFT FROM CIVIL TO CRIMINAL PRIORITY

This framework has been revised to reflect the evolution of Case 2025-137857 from a civil matter concerning financial misconduct into a **criminal matter concerning a conspiracy to obstruct justice**. The assessment model is now adapted to prioritize claims related to malicious prosecution, witness intimidation, and perjury, as these now represent the core of the case.

---

## 2. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CLAIM ASSESSMENT MODEL (REVISED)

### 2.1 Revised Assessment Dimensions

The framework now emphasizes dimensions critical to criminal and quasi-criminal claims.

```
CLAIM STRENGTH SCORE = Σ (Dimension Weight × Dimension Score)

Dimensions:
1. Evidence Quality (EQ) - Weight: 0.30 (Increased)
2. Legal Foundation (LF) - Weight: 0.25 (Increased)
3. Strategic Value (SV) - Weight: 0.20 (Increased)
4. Urgency Factor (UF) - Weight: 0.15
5. Public Interest (PI) - Weight: 0.10 (New Dimension)
```

*Note: Financial Impact (FI) and Proof Burden (PB) have been subsumed into other dimensions, as the primary goal is no longer financial recovery but criminal accountability.* 

---

## 3. NEW & REVISED DIMENSIONS

### 3.1 Strategic Value (SV) Assessment (Revised)

Focus shifts from financial leverage to criminal case impact.

| Value Type | Impact | Score | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Foundational Crime** | Exposes core motive (e.g., murder) | 9-10 | The ultimate strategic goal. |
| **Obstruction Crime** | Proves conspiracy (e.g., perjury) | 8-9 | Essential for proving intent and malice. |
| **Intimidation Crime** | Protects witness, shows pattern | 7-8 | Critical for immediate protective relief. |
| **Enabler Liability** | Expands conspiracy network | 5-6 | Holds accomplices (e.g., lawyers) accountable. |

### 3.2 Public Interest (PI) Assessment (New)

This dimension scores the claim's importance to the integrity of the justice system.

| Impact Level | Description | Score |
|---|---|---|
| **Systemic Threat** | Abuse of court process, attacks on witnesses | 9-10 |
| **Professional Misconduct** | Lawyers/experts enabling fraud | 7-8 |
| **Serious Criminality** | Concealment of murder, major fraud | 5-6 |
| **General Public Concern** | Standard corporate malfeasance | 3-4 |
