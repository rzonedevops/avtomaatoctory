## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Nature of the Application

This Honourable Court is respectfully requested to dismiss the Applicant's second interdict application seeking to compel forced medical testing of the Second Respondent ("Daniel Faucitt"). This application represents a clear abuse of the judicial process and constitutes witness intimidation in the context of ongoing criminal investigations.

### 1.2 Central Thesis

The Applicant's application is fundamentally flawed and must be dismissed on the following grounds:

1. **Constitutional Violations**: The application violates fundamental rights to dignity, bodily integrity, and privacy
2. **Malicious Prosecution**: The application is based on demonstrably false allegations made with knowledge of their falsity
3. **Witness Intimidation**: The application is designed to discredit a key witness in criminal proceedings
4. **Abuse of Process**: The court is being used for an improper purpose unrelated to legitimate civil relief

### 1.3 Urgency

This matter requires urgent intervention as the forced medical testing, if permitted, would cause irreversible harm to the Second Respondent's dignity, reputation, and effectiveness as a witness in criminal proceedings.

---

## 2. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### 2.1 The Criminal Context

**2.1.1** On June 10, 2025, Daniel Faucitt reported serious criminal conduct by Peter Faucitt to the relevant authorities, including allegations of murder-related financial crimes.

**2.1.2** This criminal complaint forms the essential context for understanding the Applicant's subsequent legal actions against Daniel Faucitt.

### 2.2 The First Interdict (August 19, 2025)

**2.2.1** Following Daniel's criminal complaint, Peter Faucitt obtained an interim interdict on August 19, 2025, approximately 70 days after the criminal report.

**2.2.2** This interdict was obtained through perjured affidavits, as subsequently confirmed by the withdrawal of ENS Africa attorneys on September 24, 2025, citing professional conduct obligations.

### 2.3 The Second Interdict (October 2025)

**2.3.1** The current application represents an escalation of the Applicant's campaign against Daniel Faucitt, now seeking forced medical testing based on fabricated allegations.

**2.3.2** The allegations center on claims that Daniel spent company funds on gambling and pornography, allegations that are demonstrably false.

### 2.4 The Bank Statement Evidence

**2.4.1** Daniel Faucitt has provided comprehensive bank statements proving that all questioned expenses were legitimate company costs paid from his personal account.

**2.4.2** These expenses were necessitated by the cancellation of company credit cards approximately six weeks prior to the transactions in question.

**2.4.3** The bank statements conclusively disprove the Applicant's allegations, establishing the malicious nature of this application.

## 3. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 Constitutional Provisions

#### 3.1.1 Section 10: Human Dignity
> "Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected."

#### 3.1.2 Section 12: Freedom and Security of the Person
> "Everyone has the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right... to bodily and psychological integrity, which includes the right to make decisions concerning reproduction; to security in and control over their body..."

#### 3.1.3 Section 14: Privacy
> "Everyone has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have their person or home searched; their property searched; their possessions seized; or the privacy of their communications infringed."

### 3.2 Relevant Case Law

#### 3.2.1 *Bernstein v Bester* 1996 (2) SA 751 (CC)
The Constitutional Court established that privacy includes the right to personal autonomy and the right to control the dissemination of information about oneself.

#### 3.2.2 *NM v Smith* 2007 (5) SA 250 (CC)
The Court emphasized that forced medical examinations constitute a significant invasion of privacy and bodily integrity, requiring compelling justification.

#### 3.2.3 *Carmichele v Minister of Safety and Security* 2001 (4) SA 938 (CC)
Established the principle that the state has a duty to protect individuals from harm, including protection from abuse of legal processes.

### 3.3 Procedural Law

#### 3.3.1 Uniform Rules of Court
Rule 35 governs medical examinations and requires that such examinations be necessary for the fair determination of the matter and that less invasive alternatives have been exhausted.

#### 3.3.2 Superior Courts Act 10 of 2013
Section 20 empowers the court to prevent abuse of its processes and to ensure that its procedures are not used for improper purposes.

## 4. CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Violation of Human Dignity (Section 10)

#### 4.1.1 The Nature of Dignity
The Constitutional Court has consistently held that human dignity is the foundational value of our constitutional order. Forced medical testing, particularly for fabricated conditions, constitutes a profound assault on human dignity.

#### 4.1.2 Specific Violations
The Applicant's demand for medical testing violates Daniel's dignity by:
- Treating him as an object to be examined rather than a person with inherent worth
- Subjecting him to humiliating procedures based on false allegations
- Using the court process to degrade and demean him publicly

#### 4.1.3 No Compelling Justification
The Applicant has failed to demonstrate any compelling justification for this violation of dignity, particularly given the demonstrably false nature of the underlying allegations.

### 4.2 Violation of Bodily Integrity (Section 12)

#### 4.2.1 The Right to Bodily Autonomy
Section 12(2) protects the right to make decisions concerning one's own body. Forced medical testing represents a direct violation of this fundamental right.

#### 4.2.2 Psychological Integrity
The threat of forced medical testing causes significant psychological harm, violating the right to psychological integrity protected under Section 12(2).

#### 4.2.3 Proportionality Analysis
Even if the Applicant had legitimate grounds (which he does not), the invasive nature of the proposed testing is wholly disproportionate to any legitimate interest.

### 4.3 Violation of Privacy (Section 14)

#### 4.3.1 Medical Privacy
Medical information is among the most private and sensitive information a person possesses. Forced medical testing violates this privacy in the most direct manner possible.

#### 4.3.2 Informational Privacy
The results of any medical testing would create private information that the Applicant seeks to obtain for improper purposes, violating informational privacy rights.

### 4.4 Constitutional Remedies

#### 4.4.1 Just and Equitable Relief
Section 38 of the Constitution empowers this Court to grant just and equitable relief for constitutional violations, including dismissing applications that violate constitutional rights.

#### 4.4.2 Costs Orders
Constitutional violations warrant punitive costs orders to deter future abuse of constitutional rights through legal processes.

## 5. MALICIOUS PROSECUTION ELEMENTS

### 5.1 Legal Framework for Malicious Prosecution

The tort of malicious prosecution requires proof of:
1. Institution of proceedings by the defendant
2. Termination of proceedings in favor of the plaintiff
3. Absence of reasonable and probable cause
4. Malice (animus injuriandi)

### 5.2 Institution of Proceedings

**5.2.1** Peter Faucitt has instituted these proceedings seeking forced medical testing of Daniel Faucitt.

### 5.3 Absence of Reasonable and Probable Cause

#### 5.3.1 False Factual Basis
The application is based on allegations that Daniel spent company funds on gambling and pornography. These allegations are demonstrably false, as proven by comprehensive bank statements.

#### 5.3.2 No Medical Indication
There is no legitimate medical indication for the proposed testing. The Applicant has not provided any medical evidence suggesting that Daniel suffers from any condition requiring testing.

#### 5.3.3 Contradictory Evidence
The Applicant persists with this application despite being provided with bank statements that conclusively disprove his allegations.

### 5.4 Malice (Animus Injuriandi)

#### 5.4.1 Improper Purpose
The true purpose of this application is not to obtain legitimate relief but to:
- Discredit Daniel as a witness in criminal proceedings
- Create false medical records suggesting mental instability or addiction
- Harass and intimidate Daniel for reporting criminal conduct

#### 5.4.2 Timeline Evidence of Malice
The timing of this application, following Daniel's criminal complaint by several months, demonstrates retaliatory intent rather than legitimate concern.

#### 5.4.3 Persistence Despite Evidence
The Applicant's persistence with false allegations despite contradictory evidence demonstrates malicious intent.

### 5.5 Legal Consequences

#### 5.5.1 Dismissal with Costs
Malicious prosecution warrants dismissal of the application with punitive costs.

#### 5.5.2 Damages Claim
Daniel Faucitt is entitled to claim damages for malicious prosecution, including reputational harm and legal costs.

## 6. WITNESS INTIMIDATION ANALYSIS

### 6.1 Criminal Law Context

#### 6.1.1 Defeating the Ends of Justice
Section 179 of the Criminal Procedure Act criminalizes conduct intended to defeat or obstruct the course of justice, including intimidating witnesses.

#### 6.1.2 Witness Protection Principles
The law recognizes the critical importance of protecting witnesses from intimidation to ensure the integrity of the criminal justice system.

### 6.2 Elements of Witness Intimidation

#### 6.2.1 Daniel's Status as Witness
Daniel Faucitt is a key witness in criminal proceedings relating to Peter Faucitt's alleged criminal conduct.

#### 6.2.2 Intimidatory Conduct
The forced medical testing application constitutes intimidatory conduct designed to:
- Discredit Daniel's testimony
- Create false evidence of mental instability
- Deter Daniel from pursuing criminal charges

#### 6.2.3 Intent to Obstruct Justice
The application is designed to obstruct the course of justice by undermining the credibility of a key witness.

### 6.3 Pattern of Escalating Intimidation

#### 6.3.1 First Interdict (August 2025)
The first interdict represented initial legal weaponization against Daniel following his criminal complaint.

#### 6.3.2 Second Interdict (October 2025)
The current application represents an escalation to direct witness intimidation through forced medical procedures.

#### 6.3.3 Systematic Campaign
The pattern demonstrates a systematic campaign to silence and discredit Daniel as a witness.

### 6.4 Legal Implications

#### 6.4.1 Court's Duty
This Court has a duty not to facilitate witness intimidation through its processes.

#### 6.4.2 Criminal Referral
The conduct evidenced in this application warrants referral to criminal authorities for investigation of witness intimidation charges.

---

## 7. ABUSE OF PROCESS

### 7.1 Legal Principles

#### 7.1.1 Proper Purpose Requirement
Court processes must be used for their proper purpose. Using civil proceedings to achieve criminal objectives constitutes abuse of process.

#### 7.1.2 Court's Inherent Jurisdiction
Courts have inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of their processes and to ensure that their procedures serve the interests of justice.

### 7.2 Improper Purpose Analysis

#### 7.2.1 Stated vs. Actual Purpose
While the application purports to seek legitimate civil relief, its actual purpose is to:
- Intimidate a criminal witness
- Create false medical evidence
- Harass Daniel for reporting crimes

#### 7.2.2 No Legitimate Civil Interest
The Applicant has no legitimate civil interest that would be served by forced medical testing based on demonstrably false allegations.

### 7.3 Harm to Judicial System

#### 7.3.1 Undermining Confidence
Allowing this application to proceed would undermine public confidence in the judicial system by demonstrating that courts can be used as weapons against crime victims.

#### 7.3.2 Precedential Harm
Permitting this abuse would set a dangerous precedent encouraging similar misuse of court processes.

### 7.4 Remedial Action Required

#### 7.4.1 Dismissal with Costs
The application must be dismissed with punitive costs to deter future abuse.

#### 7.4.2 Protective Orders
The Court should consider protective orders preventing further vexatious litigation by the Applicant.

## 8. EVIDENTIARY ANALYSIS

### 8.1 Bank Statement Evidence

#### 8.1.1 Comprehensive Documentation
Daniel has provided comprehensive bank statements covering all transactions questioned by the Applicant.

#### 8.1.2 Clear Proof of Legitimacy
The bank statements clearly demonstrate that all questioned expenses were:
- Payments to legitimate company creditors
- Necessitated by cancellation of company credit cards
- Properly documented business expenses

#### 8.1.3 Conclusive Refutation
The bank statements conclusively refute the Applicant's allegations of gambling and pornography expenditure.

### 8.2 Timeline Evidence

#### 8.2.1 Retaliatory Pattern
The timeline clearly demonstrates that this application is part of a retaliatory pattern following Daniel's criminal complaint.

#### 8.2.2 Escalating Harassment
The progression from the first interdict to this forced medical testing application shows escalating harassment.

### 8.3 Professional Conduct Evidence

#### 8.3.1 ENS Africa Withdrawal
The withdrawal of ENS Africa attorneys on September 24, 2025, citing professional conduct obligations, confirms the fraudulent nature of the first interdict.

#### 8.3.2 Pattern of Perjury
The ENS withdrawal provides independent confirmation of perjury in the first interdict, supporting the inference of continued perjury in this application.

### 8.4 Absence of Medical Evidence

#### 8.4.1 No Medical Indication
The Applicant has provided no medical evidence suggesting that Daniel requires testing for any condition.

#### 8.4.2 No Expert Opinion
The Applicant has not obtained any expert medical opinion supporting the need for testing.

#### 8.4.3 Fabricated Allegations
The allegations appear to be entirely fabricated for the purpose of justifying the testing demand.

## 10. CONCLUSION

### 10.1 Summary of Arguments

This application represents a clear abuse of the judicial process that must be firmly rejected by this Honourable Court. The Applicant seeks to use the court's authority to:

1. **Violate fundamental constitutional rights** to dignity, bodily integrity, and privacy
2. **Intimidate a key witness** in criminal proceedings through forced medical procedures
3. **Perpetuate malicious prosecution** based on demonstrably false allegations
4. **Abuse court processes** for improper purposes unrelated to legitimate civil relief

### 10.2 The Evidence is Clear

The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that:
- The underlying allegations are false (proven by bank statements)
- The application is retaliatory (timing following criminal complaint)
- The purpose is improper (witness intimidation rather than civil relief)
- Constitutional rights are violated (dignity, bodily integrity, privacy)

### 10.3 The Stakes are High

This case involves more than just the rights of Daniel Faucitt, important as they are. It involves:
- The integrity of the criminal justice system
- The protection of witnesses from intimidation
- The prevention of court process abuse
- The vindication of constitutional rights

### 10.4 The Court's Duty

This Honourable Court has both the power and the duty to:
- Protect constitutional rights from violation
- Prevent abuse of its processes
- Ensure that justice is served rather than obstructed
- Send a clear message that witness intimidation will not be tolerated

### 10.5 The Relief is Justified

The relief sought is not only justified but necessary to:
- Protect Daniel Faucitt's constitutional rights
- Preserve the integrity of criminal proceedings
- Deter future abuse of court processes
- Vindicate the rule of law

### 10.6 Final Submission

For all the reasons set out above, this Honourable Court is respectfully urged to dismiss the Applicant's application with costs on a punitive scale and to grant the protective and constitutional relief sought by the Respondents.

The forced medical testing sought by the Applicant would constitute a grave injustice and a violation of fundamental constitutional principles. This Court has the opportunity to prevent this injustice and to affirm the constitutional values that underpin our legal system.

**Justice demands nothing less than the complete dismissal of this abusive application.**
