- **Presentation**: Visual timeline showing escalation
- **Impact**: Proves witness intimidation intent

#### 3. ENS Withdrawal Letter (Independent Confirmation)

- **Impact**: Elevate case to constitutional significance

### Evidence Presentation Strategy

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Potential Challenges
