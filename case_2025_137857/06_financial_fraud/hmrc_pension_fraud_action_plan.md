## Integration with Broader Impersonation Response

This action plan should be integrated with the broader response to the impersonation scheme. The pension correspondence redirection provides additional evidence of the systematic nature of the impersonation and its escalation to target financial assets.

The evidence collected through this process should be incorporated into any legal proceedings related to the broader impersonation scheme, particularly as it demonstrates:

1. Escalation to financial fraud
2. Direct engagement with government agencies
3. Continued adaptation after discovery of previous impersonation
4. Cross-border elements of the fraud

## Conclusion

The redirection of HMRC pension correspondence represents a serious escalation in the impersonation scheme, now targeting critical financial assets. This action plan provides a structured approach to addressing the immediate threat, preserving evidence, engaging appropriate authorities, and establishing long-term protections.

Given the sophisticated nature of this fraud and its connection to the broader impersonation scheme, a comprehensive and coordinated response is essential. Each action in this plan builds upon the others to create multiple layers of protection and accountability.

Implementation should begin immediately, with particular urgency for the Priority 1 actions that will provide immediate protection against potential financial harm.
