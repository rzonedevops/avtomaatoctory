Dear Dan

Thank you for the speedy response.

Your comments and assertions will be taken under consideration in due cours=
e.

I am unfortunately away for 2 weeks, with little or no access to my communi=

In the meantime I implore everyone to try and work out a solution to the po=

On Tue, 10 Jun 2025 at 11:45, Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io<mailto:d@rzo.io>> wr=
ote:
Hi Danie

Fundamentally the issue is that Worldwide has found itself absorbing all co=
sts of all companies when the cards all expired in Aug 2023 2 weeks after K=
ayla's murder. As an emergency measure the expenses were put on the Worldwi=
de cards which had a different expiry date. This is why RegimA Skin Treatme=
nts and Strategic have no record of their actual computer expenses. Eerythi=
ng was dumped in Worldwide. The majority of these tranasactions belong in R=
ezonance, a technology and IT company Kayla and I spent nearly a decade bui=
lding. As an IT company and service provider, the operating expenses are es=
sentially different from a skincare distribution company, so an operating e=
xpense for the former would often be considered capital expenditure in the =
latter etc. As you can see from the ProfitandLoss.pdf Rezonance made its fi=
rst annual profit in Feb 2023 which Kayla and I celebrated as all the hard =
work finally paying off. Rezonance currently owes me ZAR 1.8 million as a d=
irector from my investments over the years, you can understand why I firmly=
 rejected Pete's insistence that I just close the company. In addition ther=
e was an ongoing murder investigation where the authorities reminded me of =
the familiar firearms rule that life comes before property and instructed m=
e to freeze all activity immediately while they conducted their investigati=
ons and resolve the financial issues later. Which is exactly what I have do=
ne.

Further to the question of necessity to the business, as can be seen from t=
he ProfitandLossReport (RWD).pdf RegimA Worldwide Distribution absorbed the=
 operational overhead of 4 large distribution partners between 2020 and 202=
3. It did so with no additional staff as I single-handedly rebuilt the enti=
re demand side of the distribution function into the marketplace and ecomme=
rce platforms to allow continuity of business in the wake of cascading fail=
ure of our distribution partners. The margins are structured so that each h=
ub uses its margin to cover the costs. The recent moves to take all of the =
payments directly into an account which only Rynette has access to and deny=
 me any visibility while leaving all the expenses with me are not only biza=
rre but will ultimately prevent us from ever being able to resolve anything=
 while placing someone who is neither a director or employee of Worldwide D=
istribution in complete control without any liability. This is conerning as=
 it makes me as a director liable for their actions without my knowledge or=
 consent. This cannot continue.

As can be seen in the Worldwide Distribution P&L, the year-on-year turnover=
 increase from 2M to 12M to 19M reflects the additional distribution activi=
ty it took on over the period.
The significant drop of 1M to 18M the following year was after Pete signed =
an affidavit to make himself the administrator on the Worldwide accounts an=
d all my automations were unhooked. I informed Pete and Rynette prior to th=
is not to touch it or it would break the automations but they did so anyway=
. I informed them after that I could no longer see the things i needed to c=
omplete the accounts and that they need to ensure they know what they are d=
oing. Over the past year the bank contacted me on several occasions to ask =
for my approval where Pete and Rynette had attempted to draft mandates to c=
hange the ownership structure, have my accounts closed and cancel my cards,=
 all without my knowledge or consent. I informed the bank these must be err=
ors and informed both Pete and Rynette to cease this activity immediately.

As you can see in AccountTransactionsReport.pdf the correct format up to Au=
g 2023 shows invoices from Rezonance which group the services with itemized=
 billing. This involves a 10% mark-up for Rezonance managed services which =
I use to also cover the account processing where I have a system that remun=
erates R50 for whoever is managing the 3rd party service for each invoice, =
ensuring its line items, forex rates etc are correctly filled in on quickbo=
oks for comprehensive records. After Aug 2023 you can see all items are all=
ocated to FNB which is the auto bank feed i have on Worldwide accounts.

The actual companies RegimA Zone and RegimA SA that operate the Shopify sys=
tems were configured to operate the distribution functions using trust acco=
unts and RegimA SA with Pete and I as directors was doing this with Dermal =
(Barend) and RegimA Zone (Only me as director) was an aggregation of 3 smal=
ler distributions. I had specifically structured it this way to prevent Pet=
e from doing to me what he did to Kachan, simply taking the revenue for him=
self by instructing people to pay into another account (which is basically =
what has happened). The problem is that since the ownership of the companie=
s is not the same (i.e. I am not a member of RegimA Skin Treatments and the=
 other companies are not subsidiaries), therefore there is no fixed "group"=
 or intercompany and moving assets from a company where I am a director to =
a company where I am not is essentially theft or at the very least fraudule=
nt for tax purposes. I urge you to keep this in mind as these issues should=
 not be dismissed as "family disputes" when there is a distinct material an=
d legal difference between ownership of companies which should be treated a=
s such.

I have been telling both Pete and Rynette for 4 years now that the outstand=
ing amounts owed to Rezonance need to be paid before I am able to purchase =
the services and continue as normal, attached is the Rezonance Febr 2023.PD=
F showing over 1M outstanding owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance. =
I have been telling Pete for over a year that I cannot file the accounts fo=
r Rezonance until the errors of 2024 are corrected in RegimA Skin Treatment=
s. RST has had an account with GoDaddy since 2014 which is also an internat=
ional payments account with some forex etc. For reasons I can only speculat=
e, in 2024 Rynette made the debt to Rezonance "disappear" by misallocating =
international GoDaddy payments as though they were local payments made to R=
ezonance, yet Rezonance received no such payments (the amounts are still ou=
tstanding). I was explaining to Pete that these need to be corrected before=
 I submit Rezonance accounts as there will immediately be a mismatch showin=
g Rezonance never received the payments and they will flag as fraudulent on=
 RegimA Skin Treatments with SARS. This was just ignored and they opted ins=
tead to try and close my accounts and dissolve my company. This cannot cont=
inue.

To the best of my understanding the course we need to follow for correct ac=
counts is:


  1.
Inform SARS about my freezing activity on the accounts in cooperaion with l=
aw enforcement for the murder inquiry
  2.
Explain that we are now in the process of updating the affected records to =
reconcile the past 2 years so it reflects an accurate account
  3.
Make the payments from RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance and correctly al=
locate the 2014 GoDaddy expenses to GoDaddy
  4.
Process the Invoices in the same way I had been doing up until Aug 2023 so =
there is a single invoice from Rezonance each month.
  5.
Configure the Paystack systems on Shopify to split the payments directly in=
to Distrivbution and Manufacturer accounts.

Other than that I can't see any other way to properly remedy the situation.=
 We cannot just try to shoehorn an entire architecture for multiple distrib=
ution operations into one account. The transactions on RegimA Skin Treatmen=
ts must not be signed off as they will later show up as fraudulent. Bear in=
 mind that Pete does not use the computer and has never seen the actual acc=
ounts for the company, nor has Jacqui and nor have I. They exist solely on =
Rynette's computer and nobody else is able to see them. The amounts I can s=
ee going through Strategic and RegimA Skin Treatments seem off the charts s=
o we need an internal audit with extreme urgency to see what is going on th=
ere.

Warm Regards,
Dan

Subject: The RegimA Group results and Computer Expense analysis

Good morning Pete, Jacqui and Danny

It saddens me to write this email this morning, as in my 30-odd year involv=
ement with the Faucitt family business I have never had to encounter or get=
 involved with an internal dispute of this serious nature.

Although perhaps difficult for you as family members, I suggest we try and =
keep the emotions at bay and resolve this dispute regarding the spend on Co=
mputer related expenses by applying basic business principles in deciding w=
hat needs to be done to restore the profitability and ultimate survival of =
the business going forward. What do you think?

Just a friendly request please, not to send me any relevant information and=
 comments privately. We all need to be working as a team to be able to asce=
rtain the potential problem/s and focus on finding the most viable solution=
/s.

Danny has responded to my email of 26th May, his email attached. Danny, man=
y thanks for the very professional and detailed analyses you have provided.

I would still like for the Excel printouts I've attached to be answered lin=
e by line please.

Your email contains a lot of information. It is a lot to digest. By doing a=
 category analysis helps tremendously to understand the nature and purpose =
of all the various IT related services and platforms that are used througho=
ut the RegimA Group.

I am neither an IT expert, nor am I an e-Commerce expert so I would not be =
able to comment on the necessity, use and value each expense adds to the co=
mpany.

What is clear though, is that the RegimA group has over the past few years =
invested heavily in IT and e-commerce platforms and continues to do so. For=
 any business to spend in excess of 20% of revenue generated on these servi=
ces, the spend needs to be justified, transparent, relevant and needs to ad=
d the desired value to the business, i.e. it has to benefit the "bottom lin=
e".

Insofar as these computer expenses are concerned, I suggest we need to ask =
ourselves these questions to start off with:
1. Do we have the necessary invoices for each expense to be able to satisfy=
 a SARS investigation?
2. Verify what each expense is used for on a daily basis?
3. Confirm the sales volume and value generated by each and every e-commerc=
e platform the company is paying for.
4. Consider the relevance and necessity of all collaboration, communication=
, marketing, development , AI services as well as Analytics & Monitoring to=
ols and do a cost-benefit analysis.on each and every service paid for.

The other concerning aspect is that from my high-level analysis of the stat=
e of the finances of the RegimA Group as at 28 February 2025, it is concern=
ing to notice that the Group has, for the first time in its history, made a=
 substantial trading loss in the past financial year.

This reflects in the bank balances as well, which saw a decline of R10m yea=
r-on-year for the Group, including Villa Via.

So, besides considering Computer Expenses, other aspects of the business li=
ke product margins, selling and distribution costs etc. needs to be looked =
at in depth again.

This will hopefully be the start of an in-depth discussion regarding the pr=
ofitability and ultimate future viability of the business.


Kind regards,

Danie Bantjes

Fundamentally the issue is that Worldwide has found itself absorbing all co=
sts of all companies when the cards all expired in Aug 2023 2 weeks after K=
ayla's murder. As an emergency measure the expenses were put on the Worldwi=
de cards which had a different expiry
 date. This is why RegimA Skin Treatments and Strategic have no record of t=
heir actual computer expenses. Eerything was dumped in Worldwide. The major=
ity of these tranasactions belong in Rezonance, a technology and IT company=
 Kayla and I spent nearly a decade
 building. As an IT company and service provider, the operating expenses ar=
e essentially different from a skincare distribution company, so an operati=
ng expense for the former would often be considered capital expenditure in =
the latter etc. As you can see from
 the ProfitandLoss.pdf Rezonance made its first annual profit in Feb 2023 w=
hich Kayla and I celebrated as all the hard work finally paying off. Rezona=
nce currently owes me ZAR 1.8 million as a director from my investments ove=
r the years, you can understand
 why I firmly rejected Pete's insistence that I just close the company. In =
addition there was an ongoing murder investigation where the authorities re=
minded me of the familiar firearms rule that life comes before property and=
 instructed me to freeze all activity
 immediately while they conducted their investigations and resolve the fina=
ncial issues later. Which is exactly what I have done.</div>

Further to the question of necessity to the business, as can be seen from t=
he ProfitandLossReport (RWD).pdf RegimA Worldwide Distribution absorbed the=
 operational overhead of 4 large distribution partners between 2020 and 202=
3. It did so with no additional
 staff as I single-handedly rebuilt the entire demand side of the distribut=
ion function into the marketplace and ecommerce platforms to allow continui=
ty of business in the wake of cascading failure of our distribution partner=
s. The margins are structured so
 that each hub uses its margin to cover the costs. The recent moves to take=
 all of the payments directly into an account which only Rynette has access=
 to and deny me any visibility while leaving all the expenses with me are n=
ot only bizarre but will ultimately
 prevent us from ever being able to resolve anything while placing someone =
who is neither a director or employee of Worldwide Distribution in complete=
 control without any liability. This is conerning as it makes me as a direc=
tor liable for their actions without
 my knowledge or consent. This cannot continue.</div>

As can be seen in the Worldwide Distribution P&amp;L, the year-on-year turn=
over increase from 2M to 12M to 19M reflects the additional distribution ac=
tivity it took on over the period.</div>

The significant drop of 1M to 18M the following year was after Pete signed =
an affidavit to make himself the administrator on the Worldwide accounts an=
d all my automations were unhooked. I informed Pete and Rynette prior to th=
is not to touch it or it would break
 the automations but they did so anyway. I informed them after that I could=
 no longer see the things i needed to complete the accounts and that they n=
eed to ensure they know what they are doing. Over the past year the bank co=
ntacted me on several occasions
 to ask for my approval where Pete and Rynette had attempted to draft manda=
tes to change the ownership structure, have my accounts closed and cancel m=
y cards, all without my knowledge or consent. I informed the bank these mus=
t be errors and informed both Pete
 and Rynette to cease this activity immediately.</div>

As you can see in AccountTransactionsReport.pdf the correct format up to Au=
g 2023 shows invoices from Rezonance which group the services with itemized=
 billing. This involves a 10% mark-up for Rezonance managed services which =
I use to also cover the account
 processing where I have a system that remunerates R50 for whoever is manag=
ing the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party service for each invoice, ensuring its li=
ne items, forex rates etc are correctly filled in on quickbooks for compreh=
ensive records. After Aug 2023 you can
 see all items are allocated to FNB which is the auto bank feed i have on W=
orldwide accounts.&nbsp;</div>

The actual companies RegimA Zone and RegimA SA that operate the Shopify sys=
tems were configured to operate the distribution functions using trust acco=
unts and RegimA SA with Pete and I as directors was doing this with Dermal =
(Barend) and RegimA Zone (Only me
 as director) was an aggregation of 3 smaller distributions. I had specific=
ally structured it this way to prevent Pete from doing to me what he did to=
 Kachan, simply taking the revenue for himself by instructing people to pay=
 into another account (which is
 basically what has happened). The problem is that since the ownership of t=
he companies is not the same (i.e. I am not a member of RegimA Skin Treatme=
nts and the other companies are not subsidiaries), therefore there is no fi=
xed &quot;group&quot; or intercompany and
 moving assets from a company where I am a director to a company where I am=
 not is essentially theft or at the very least fraudulent for tax purposes.=
 I urge you to keep this in mind as these issues should not be dismissed as=
 &quot;family disputes&quot; when there is
 a distinct material and legal difference between ownership of companies wh=
ich should be treated as such.</div>

I have been telling both Pete and Rynette for 4 years now that the outstand=
ing amounts owed to Rezonance need to be paid before I am able to purchase =
the services and continue as normal, attached is the Rezonance Febr 2023.PD=
F showing over 1M outstanding owed
 by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance. I have been telling Pete for over =
a year that I cannot file the accounts for Rezonance until the errors of 20=
24 are corrected in RegimA Skin Treatments. RST has had an account with GoD=
addy since 2014 which is also an
 international payments account with some forex etc. For reasons I can only=
 speculate, in 2024 Rynette made the debt to Rezonance &quot;disappear&quot=
; by misallocating international GoDaddy payments as though they were local=
 payments made to Rezonance, yet Rezonance
 received no such payments (the amounts are still outstanding). I was expla=
ining to Pete that these need to be corrected before I submit Rezonance acc=
ounts as there will immediately be a mismatch showing Rezonance never recei=
ved the payments and they will flag
 as fraudulent on RegimA Skin Treatments with SARS. This was just ignored a=

Other than that I can't see any other way to properly remedy the situation.=
 We cannot just try to shoehorn an entire architecture for multiple distrib=
ution operations into one account. The transactions on RegimA Skin Treatmen=
ts must not be signed off as they
 will later show up as fraudulent. Bear in mind that Pete does not use the =
computer and has never seen the actual accounts for the company, nor has Ja=
cqui and nor have I. They exist solely on Rynette's computer and nobody els=
e is able to see them. The amounts
 I can see going through Strategic and RegimA Skin Treatments seem off the =
charts so we need an internal audit with extreme urgency to see what is goi=
ng on there.</div>

</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Good morning Pete, Jacqui and Danny</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">It saddens me to write this email this morning=
, as in my 30-odd year involvement with the Faucitt family business I have =
never had to encounter or get involved with an internal dispute of this ser=
ious nature.&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Although perhaps difficult for you as family m=
embers, I suggest we try and keep the emotions&nbsp;at bay and resolve this=
 dispute regarding the spend on Computer related expenses by applying basic=
 business principles in deciding what needs
 to be done to restore the profitability and ultimate&nbsp;survival of the =
business going forward. What&nbsp;do you think?</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Just a friendly request please, not to send me=
 any relevant information and comments privately. We all need to be working=
 as a team to be able to ascertain the potential problem/s and focus on fin=
ding the most viable solution/s.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Danny has responded to my email of 26th May, h=
is email attached. Danny, many thanks for the very professional and detaile=
d analyses you have provided.&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">I would still like for the Excel printouts I'v=
e attached to be answered line&nbsp;by line please.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Your email contains a lot of information. It i=
s a lot to digest. By doing a category analysis helps tremendously to under=
stand the nature and purpose of all the various IT related services and pla=
tforms that are used throughout the
 RegimA Group.&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">I am neither an IT expert, nor am I an e-Comme=
rce expert so I would not be able to comment on the necessity, use and valu=
e each expense adds to the company.&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">What is clear though, is that the RegimA group=
 has over the past few years invested heavily in IT and e-commerce platform=
s and continues to do so. For any business to spend in excess of 20% of rev=
enue generated on these services,
 the spend needs to be justified, transparent, relevant and needs to add th=
e desired value to the business, i.e. it has to benefit the &quot;bottom li=
ne&quot;.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Insofar as these computer expenses are concern=
ed, I suggest we need to ask ourselves these questions to start off with:</=
div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">1. Do we have the necessary invoices for each =
expense to be able to satisfy a SARS investigation?</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">2. Verify what each expense is used for on a d=
aily basis?</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">3. Confirm the sales volume and value generate=
d by each and every e-commerce platform the company is paying for.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">4. Consider the relevance and necessity of all=
 collaboration, communication, marketing, development , AI services as well=
 as Analytics &amp; Monitoring tools and do a cost-benefit analysis.on each=
 and every service paid for.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">The other concerning aspect is that from my hi=
gh-level analysis&nbsp;of the state of the finances of the RegimA Group as =
at 28 February 2025, it is concerning to notice that the Group has, for the=
 first time in its history, made a substantial
 trading loss in the past financial year.&nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">This reflects in the bank balances as well, wh=
ich saw a decline of R10m year-on-year for the Group, including Villa Via.&=
nbsp;</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">So, besides considering Computer Expenses, oth=
er aspects of the business like product margins, selling and distribution c=
osts etc. needs to be looked at in depth again.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">This will hopefully be the start of an in-dept=
h discussion regarding the profitability and ultimate future viability of t=
he business.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Kind regards,</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
