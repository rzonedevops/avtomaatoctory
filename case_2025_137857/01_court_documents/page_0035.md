The third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive
payment therefrom due to apparent fraud that transpired in the UK in
the past, from which the UK companies allagedly required time to again

become financially viable.

This was perpetrated by the then Managing director of the UK branch,

isaac Chesno, which resultant in our son’s appointment,

I fear (due to his present conduct) that the coritinued non-payme:

the UK branch, may inter alfa be a ruse.

l accordingly have no idea pertaining to the financial wellness of the UK
branches, and intend to approach the relevant Court for relief with re-

gards thereto.
42.

I Say, with respect, that the orders sought under PART B of the notice
of motion are essential to the survival of the third ‘fo sixth respondents,
as the relationship between the directors and members (namely the first
and second respondents, and 1) has disintegrated and become dead-
locked to the extent that they would otherwise have to be liquidated, fo
my significant detriment, and to the detriment of my wife, and son, who
are sustained by those corporations ~ as well as to the detriment of the

corporations.
