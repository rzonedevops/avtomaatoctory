The 2025 tax year, thus far, for this category only, amounts to

R2,116,159.47,

These amounts exclude the ‘birthday gift, aforesaid, and are almost

entirely unexplainable.

Many of the ‘expenses’ are also seemingly international.

Annexed hereto marked “PF 41” is a screenshot of a message received

from the seventh respondent bank, on or about 05 August 2025, con-

firming that the business accounts have almost exceeded the yearly

allowable quota for funds leaving the Republic of South Africa (I note,

in this regard, that the corporations bank together, effectively as a group

of companies ~ their funds are inter alia pooled as necessary).

ous, tax implications fer the applicant corporations, to their signi

detriment.

For the sake of inter alia the South African Revenue Services, and the

Reserve Bank, the corporations will, as it stands, be unable to explain

these intemational expenses.

The aforesaid, which appears to constitute substantial financial miscon-

duct, is neither sustainable, nor acceptable.

None of the respondents (third to sixth) are resellers in technology or

technological related items, or services,

Other than a few minor costs for accounting services, internat hosting,
and the like, the ‘expenses’ to which I have referred above, are unre-

lated to the business of the applicants.

The aforesaid is entirely due to my son, who is defended, and enabled
by my wife, and indicates the misappropriation of substantial sums of

money from the corporations aforesaid, to their significant detriment.

AD DECLARATIONS OF DELINQUENCY, PROBATION SOUGHT IN THE NO.
Ti CE OF MOTION

10.1

10.2,

10.3

I seek, as final relief under PART B of the notice of motion, an order
declaring the first, and second respondents delinquent, alternatively

placing them under probation.

I deal therewith at the outset, as their conduct justifying that relief ex-

plains the necessity for the relief I seek under PART A.

My son and wife are, with respect, clearly and evidently acting in a man-
ner which is detrimental to the third to the sixth respondent corpora-

tions, and to me, to the extent that their conduct is delinquent alterna-

Mt

14/8/2025-8:16:25 AM

The third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive
payment therefrom due to apparent fraud that transpired in the UK in
the past, from which the UK companies allagedly required time to again

become financially viable.

This was perpetrated by the then Managing director of the UK branch,

isaac Chesno, which resultant in our son’s appointment,

I fear (due to his present conduct) that the coritinued non-payme:

the UK branch, may inter alfa be a ruse.

l accordingly have no idea pertaining to the financial wellness of the UK
branches, and intend to approach the relevant Court for relief with re-

gards thereto.
42.

I Say, with respect, that the orders sought under PART B of the notice
of motion are essential to the survival of the third ‘fo sixth respondents,
as the relationship between the directors and members (namely the first
and second respondents, and 1) has disintegrated and become dead-
locked to the extent that they would otherwise have to be liquidated, fo
my significant detriment, and to the detriment of my wife, and son, who
are sustained by those corporations ~ as well as to the detriment of the

corporations.

12.2 Neediess to say, with respect, the extent to which money appears to
have been misappropriated from the third to sixth respondents (which
has unquestionably flowed out of those corporations, and very irregu-
larly at that), which continues, is not sustainable, has already created
significant taxation problems, and will inescapably lead to their insol-

veney.

12.3 ! approach this Honourable Court to prevent this,

12.4 it goes without saying, with respect, that my wife and son canigar
those Corporations in capacities other than director or member, and can

be sustained thereby,

13.

AD INTERDICTS SOUGHT IN THE NOTICE OF MOTION

13.4 I gay further, with respect, that the interdicts (and other relief} sought
under PART A of the notice of motion are also essential to the survival
of the third to sixth respondents; the rot must, with respect, be stopped
urgently, which will be impossibie in the absence of appropriate inter-

dictory relief, such as is set out in therein.

apprehension of further, and irreparable harm if the interdicts { Seek are

not granted,

this Honourable Court for essential interdictory (and other) relief, as I

In the premises, { say with respect that I am entitled to the relief { seak

I ask, with respect, that any relief not granted under PART A of the no-
tice of motion be adjudicated under PART B thereof,

14,

As appears from PART A of the notice of motion, I also ask for orders
enabling me to take contro! of the financial administration of the third to
sixth respondents (which is essential for their survival, and to com-
mence, and prosecute a forensic investigation into their financial affairs,
for which purpose the compliance of the first and second respondents

is essential,

it is vital, with respect, that such funds &$ may be recovered (pursuant
fo a forensic investigation) are restored to the aforesaid corporations,
so that they can meet their tax obligations, and continue with their busi-

nesses.

14.3 It is also essential that the first and Second respondent are constrained
to the extent that they can no longer cause financial prejudice to the

third to sixth respondents,

14.4 The forensic audit is also necessary for purposes of PART B of the no-
tice of motion; I have no objection to the first and second respondents

continuing to receive their present remuneration until PART B is finally

adjudicated; it is essential, however, that they are not permitted to par-

ABURGENCY

16.1 The conduct of the first and second respondents was only discovered
(and partially 80) during mid June 20265; at that Slage we were stifi trying

to establish why those Payments had been made, and the authors

AS thereof.

16.2 On or about 16 duly 2025, when the first respondent transferred the
sum of R600,000.00 to the second fespondent, it became Clear that
action had to be taken to protect the third to sixth respondents.

18.3 The conduct, Pertaining to unnecessary funds leaving the businesses

at the first and/or Second respondents’ behest, is continual,

oy 16.4 As may be expected, with fespect, I was still in a state of shack (which
resulted in me not being able to think Clearly) when I approached my
attorneys of record for advice, on 05 August 2025,

16.5 I was unaware that an urgent application to thie Honourable Court could

J have also been required to proceed, as is extremely difficult, with such
instructions to my attomeys of record Secretively, so as to prevent any
funds leaving the corporations as a result of such instructions ~ or any

other untoward ‘knee-jerk’ reactions.

OTHAPAIEA

This has, as a result, been a more time consuming manner in whi

provide instructions to my attorneys of record.

I say with respect, however, that every passing day constitutes a new
ground of urgency due to the first and second respondent's reckless,
and delinquent conduct that indicates clearly that they will not cease

their transgressions.

Itis probable, with respect, that the third to sixth respondents will suffer
itremediable harm if the first and second respondent's are not stopped

from continuing their misconduct as soon as possible.

Doubiless, with respect, the misappropriated money has been squan-

dered andfor concealed.

respondent having immediately and defiantly transferred the sur of

not subject to an appropriate order — request an order that they
