### **NOTICE OF VOIDNESS OF ALL INTERDICTS AND AGREEMENTS DUE TO ONGOING CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY, PERJURY, AND WITNESS INTIMIDATION**

**DATE:** [Today's Date]

**CASE REFERENCE:** 2025-137857 & Related Matters

---

### **1. THE INITIAL CRIME: PERJURY AND FRAUD (FIRST INTERDICT)**

1.1. As previously notified, we possess irrefutable documentary evidence (email dated June 10, 2025) proving that Peter Faucitt and Danie Bantjies had full knowledge of murder and financial crimes when they submitted perjured affidavits to obtain the ex parte interdict of August 19, 2025.

1.2. This act rendered the interdict, and all subsequent agreements, **void ab initio** (void from the beginning).

### **2. THE ESCALATION: WITNESS INTIMIDATION & MALICIOUS PROSECUTION (SECOND INTERDICT)**

2.1. Following the exposure of the initial fraud (evidenced by the withdrawal of ENS Africa), Peter Faucitt has escalated his criminal campaign by launching a **second interdict application**.

2.2. This second application is a clear and unambiguous act of **witness intimidation** and **malicious prosecution**, based on:
    - **Fabricated Allegations**: Claims of gambling/pornography addiction that are demonstrably false.
    - **Suppressed Evidence**: Deliberately ignoring bank statements provided by Daniel Faucitt that prove the expenses in question are legitimate business costs.
    - **Abusive Relief Sought**: Demanding forced, invasive medical testing, a tactic designed not for legal remedy but to harass, humiliate, and discredit a key witness in a murder investigation.

2.3. This second interdict provides fresh, independent proof of the malicious intent (**animus injuriandi**) that has driven this entire process from the outset.

### **3. LEGAL EFFECT: A CONTINUING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE**

3.1. The combination of the perjured first interdict and the malicious second interdict demonstrates a **continuing criminal enterprise** aimed at obstructing justice.

3.2. Under South African law, all actions arising from this criminal conspiracy are a legal nullity.

### **4. DECLARATION OF VOIDNESS (EXPANDED)**

**ACCORDINGLY, TAKE NOTICE THAT:**

4.1. **ALL INTERDICTS (First and Second) are VOID** and unenforceable.

4.2. **ALL proceedings and agreements** based on these void interdicts are **NULL AND VOID**.

4.3. **No compliance is required** with any aspect of these fraudulent legal actions.

### **5. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION (EXPANDED CHARGES)**

5.1. This entire matter, including the filing of the second interdict, has been submitted to the Hawks for investigation of:
    - **Witness Intimidation** (a Schedule 1 offense)
    - **Malicious Prosecution**
    - **Defeating and Obstructing the Course of Justice**
    - **Perjury**
    - **Fraud**
    - **Conspiracy**

5.2. Any attempt to proceed with the second interdict will be treated as a further act in this criminal conspiracy and will be reported to the authorities as such.

### **6. DEMANDS (UPDATED)**

We hereby demand:

6.1. **Immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the second interdict application**.
6.2. Immediate acknowledgment that all interdicts and settlements are void.
6.3. Cessation of all contact with Daniel Faucitt except through our legal representatives or the Hawks.

### **7. WARNING**

7.1. Proceeding with the second interdict application after receiving this notice and the evidence disproving your claims will be used as definitive proof of your malicious intent in the ensuing criminal and civil proceedings.

### **8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS**

8.1. We reserve all rights, including the right to bring a civil claim for substantial damages for malicious prosecution and to seek punitive cost orders against all involved parties and legal representatives.
