# Medical Coercion & Witness Intimidation Analysis (REVISED)

### Analysis Date: Monday, October 6, 2025

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document analyzes the evidence of medical coercion in Case 2025-137857. The initial evidence (the September 2, 2025 letter) revealed a plan to use medical testing as a tool for extortion. The filing of the **second interdict** in October 2025 has transformed this plan into a concrete act of **witness intimidation and malicious prosecution**. The court is now being actively used to execute the discrediting scheme.

## THE EVOLUTION OF THE MEDICAL COERCION SCHEME

### Phase 1: The Plan (September 2, 2025 Letter)

-   **The Tactic**: Elliott Attorneys, on behalf of Peter Faucitt, proposed neurological and drug testing as a "condition" for mediation.
-   **The Pretext**: Fabricated claims of "forgetfulness" and "behavioral changes."
-   **The Goal**: To create a basis for discrediting Daniel and Jacqueline Faucitt as witnesses.

### Phase 2: The Act (October 2025 Second Interdict)

-   **The Tactic**: Peter Faucitt launched a formal court application to compel forced medical testing of Daniel Faucitt.
-   **The Pretext**: New, fabricated allegations of gambling and pornography addiction, supported by a deliberate misreading of bank statements.
-   **The Goal**: To obtain a court order to enforce the discrediting scheme, thereby giving it a veneer of legitimacy.

## THE SECOND INTERDICT AS PRIMARY EVIDENCE

The second interdict is now the **primary evidence** of the witness intimidation conspiracy. It proves:

1.  **Malicious Intent**: The allegations are demonstrably false (proven by bank statements), which establishes malice.
2.  **Abuse of Process**: The court is being used for an improper purpose – to harass and discredit a witness, not to resolve a legitimate dispute.
3.  **Witness Intimidation**: The act of forcing a witness into invasive medical testing under threat of a court order is a clear act of intimidation.

### Additional Evidence from the Original Plan

1. **False Pretexts for Testing:**
   - Claims Jacqueline is "forgetful" and can't recall documentation
   - Claims Daniel has "unexplained behavioral changes"
   - These are PRETEXTS to force psychiatric/drug testing

2. **Conditions for Mediation:**
   - Neurological assessment for Jacqueline (point 4)
   - Drug screening for Daniel (point 5)
   - Framed as "fairness" when it's actually EXTORTION

3. **Timeline Confirms Conspiracy:**
   - August 29: ENS receives murder/fraud evidence
   - September 2: Instead of addressing crimes, they push medical testing
   - This proves they're using testing to DISCREDIT crime witnesses

## THE SECOND INTERDICT - ESCALATION AFTER EVIDENCE SUBMISSION

### Peter's Desperate Escalation Pattern:

4. **Second Interdict Filed Despite Evidence:**
   - Peter issued a second interdict attempting forced medical testing
   - Based on false allegations that Daniel spent money on gambling & porn
   - Filed AFTER Daniel submitted bank statements proving expenses were legitimate company costs
   - Shows Peter is rushing past evidence to force medical testing

5. **Daniel's Bank Statement Defense:**
   - Daniel submitted comprehensive bank statements to ENS
   - Statements clearly show expenses were company creditors paid from personal account
   - Due to card cancellations 6 weeks earlier, Daniel was forced to pay company expenses personally
   - Bank records prove legitimate business expenses, not gambling/porn as alleged

6. **Peter's Rush to Medical Testing:**
   - Despite bank statements proving legitimate expenses, Peter persists with medical testing demands
   - Shows the medical testing was never about actual evidence
   - Demonstrates determination to force psychiatric evaluation regardless of facts
   - Proves medical testing is a weapon, not a legitimate inquiry

## CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS (REVISED)

The filing of the second interdict elevates the conspiracy from planning to execution. The key charges are now:

-   **Witness Intimidation**: The primary charge, evidenced by the court application itself.
-   **Defeating the Ends of Justice**: By attempting to neutralize the key witness in a murder investigation.
-   **Perjury**: In the affidavits supporting the second interdict, which contain the fabricated allegations.
-   **Malicious Prosecution**: Filing false claims despite contradicting evidence.
-   **Defamation**: Making false public allegations about gambling/porn spending.
-   **Abuse of Court Process**: Using interdicts as harassment tool rather than legitimate relief.

## HAWKS FILING PREPARATION (UPDATED)

### Evidence Summary for Hawks Statement

-   **Primary Evidence**: The Second Interdict Application.
-   **Supporting Evidence**: The September 2, 2025 letter (shows premeditation), and the bank statements (proves malice).

### Recommended Hawks Statement Addition:
"Peter Faucitt has now filed a second, malicious interdict to force me to undergo medical testing for fabricated addictions. He is ignoring the bank statements that prove his claims are false. This is a direct attempt to intimidate and discredit me as a witness in the murder and fraud case. The attached court application is the evidence of this crime.

The pattern is clear: I report crimes → They claim I'm mentally unstable → Force testing to create 'evidence' I'm unreliable → Use this to dismiss murder/fraud reports.

When bank statements proved the first allegations false, Peter immediately filed a second interdict with more extreme false claims. This shows the medical testing demand was never evidence-based - it's a systematic attempt to silence crime witnesses through forced psychiatric evaluation."

---

**Conclusion**: The medical coercion scheme is no longer a threat; it is an active, ongoing crime being committed through the courts. The second interdict application is the confession, and it must be treated as the primary evidence in the criminal prosecution for witness intimidation.
