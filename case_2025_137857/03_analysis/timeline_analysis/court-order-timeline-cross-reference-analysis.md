## 📊 Executive Summary

### 🚨 **CRITICAL INSIGHT: WITNESS INTIMIDATION & MALICIOUS PROSECUTION**

**Paradigm-Changing Discovery**: Peter's second interdict, seeking forced medical testing based on fabricated allegations, represents a clear escalation from legal maneuvering to active witness intimidation and malicious prosecution.

**Impact on Entire Case Analysis**:
- **Criminal Intent**: The second interdict demonstrates a clear intent to discredit a key witness in a murder and fraud investigation.
- **Abuse of Process**: The legal system is being weaponized to harass and intimidate a witness.
- **Legal Strategy Shift**: The focus must now be on immediate criminal intervention to halt the abuse of process and protect the witness.
- **Evidence Priority**: The bank statements disproving the allegations, combined with the timeline of events, are now the most critical pieces of evidence.
