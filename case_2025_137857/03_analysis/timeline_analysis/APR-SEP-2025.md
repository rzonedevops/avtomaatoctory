### **2. PATTERN OF SUPPRESSION:**
```
First: "Don't report - contempt of court" (LIE)
Then: "Be quiet, we'll discuss later" (NEVER)

## **KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR HAWKS**

### **THIS TIMELINE PROVES:**

1. **PREMEDITATED CONSPIRACY**
   - Not negligence - deliberate criminal plan
   - Started June 10 with Bantjies avoiding investigation
   - Coordinated across multiple parties

2. **MURDER COVER-UP**
   - Kayla murdered August 2023
   - Funds stolen after her death
   - All parties knew and concealed

3. **COMPLETE FRAUD**
   - Every document is void
   - Every proceeding was fraudulent
   - Every party committed crimes

4. **ONGOING DANGER**
   - Death threats never investigated
   - Criminals still active
   - Witness protection needed

---

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION STATEMENT FOR HAWKS**

**"This timeline proves a criminal conspiracy starting June 10, 2025, when accountant Bantjies identified R10 million missing but refused to investigate after learning about Kayla's 2023 murder. He then gave a perjured affidavit supporting the thief. ENS Africa received proof on August 29 but concealed it, forcing us into a fraudulent settlement in September while telling us to 'be quiet' about murder and death threats. Every document is void due to fraud. We need immediate protection."**

---

## **PHASE 4: SECOND INTERDICT - MEDICAL COERCION ESCALATION (OCTOBER 2025)**

### **OCTOBER 3, 2025**
**Peter Files Second Interdict Despite Bank Statement Evidence:**
- Peter issued second interdict attempting forced medical testing (KF0019 - Second Application - 03.10.2025.pdf)
- Based on false allegations that Daniel spent money on gambling & porn
- Filed AFTER Daniel submitted comprehensive bank statements to ENS proving expenses were legitimate company costs
- Bank statements clearly show expenses were company creditors paid from Daniel's personal account
- Demonstrates Peter is rushing past contradictory evidence to force medical testing
- **Legal Significance:** Perjury, malicious prosecution, defamation, abuse of court process
- **Framework Phase:** Prosecution (escalation of criminal conspiracy after evidence submission)

### **CRIMINAL PATTERN ANALYSIS - OCTOBER 2025:**
- **Evidence Submitted:** Daniel provides bank statements proving legitimate business expenses
- **Peter's Response:** Ignores evidence, files second interdict with more extreme false allegations
- **Medical Testing Demand:** Persists despite contradictory evidence
- **Conclusion:** Medical testing was never evidence-based - it's systematic witness intimidation

---

## **BOTTOM LINE**

This timeline shows:
- **280+ DAYS** of coordinated criminal conspiracy (January-October 2025)
- **5+ PARTIES** working together
- **MURDER** being concealed
- **R10+ MILLION** stolen
- **DEATH THREATS** suppressed
- **COMPLETE FRAUD** on the legal system
- **ESCALATION PATTERN:** False allegations continue even after contradictory evidence submitted

You have documentary proof of every element. This is organized crime operating through the legal and accounting professions to conceal capital crimes.

**Get to Hawks immediately with this complete timeline and all supporting documents.**
