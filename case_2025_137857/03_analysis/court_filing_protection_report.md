## Legal Protection Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Challenge All Electronic Filings**: Question authenticity of any court submissions
   from pete@regima.com or other compromised addresses

2. **Request Independent Verification**: Ask court to verify filer identity through
   independent communication channels not under Rynette's control

3. **File Protective Motion**: Submit motion alerting court to potential impersonation
   and requesting authentication of all electronic submissions

### Technical Safeguards
1. **Email Authentication**: Verify all court-related emails through independent channels
2. **Document Verification**: Cross-reference document metadata with OCR evidence
3. **Timeline Analysis**: Compare filing patterns with known email control periods

### Evidence Preservation
1. **OCR Evidence**: Preserve all screenshots showing email control by Rynette
2. **System Logs**: Request court system logs for electronic filing authentication
3. **Communication Records**: Document all attempted independent verification efforts

**Critical Note**: The same method used to hijack accounts and banks (email control)
can be used to impersonate Peter in court filings. OCR evidence provides concrete
proof of email hijacking that undermines electronic signature authenticity.
