**Appointed Party**:
- **Peter Andrew Faucitt** - ID: 520430 5708 185 (appointed as Main Trustee)

### Critical Analysis

**Backdating Evidence**:
- Appointment states "Date of Appointment: 1 July 2025"

- **41-day backdating** from actual signing to stated appointment date

**Self-Appointment**:
- Peter Andrew Faucitt appoints himself as Main Trustee
- Jacqueline Faucitt (Jax) co-signs the appointment
- **Potential duress**: Jax signing document that consolidates Peter's control

**Timing Significance**:
- July 1, 2025: Stated appointment date (during email domain hijacking period)
- August 11, 2025: Actual signing date (one day before email to Bantjies)

**Legal Implications**:

## Critical Evidence 3: Bantjies Email - August 27, 2025

### Email Details
- **From**: Daniel Faucitt (dan@regima.zone)
- **To**: jfaucitt@proton.me (Jax)
- **CC**: Daniel J. Faucitt (dan@regima.com)
- **Subject**: danie request
- **Date**: August 27, 2025, 10:29:27 UTC

### Email Content

**Bantjies' Requests**:
1. **Impartiality Statement**: "I prefer not to meet with individual parties regarding this matter to maintain my impartiality"
2. **Factual Report Promise**:
   - Consolidated External Revenues (past 2 years)
   - Consolidated Net Trading Profits/Losses (past 2 financial years)
   - Computer expenses (past 2 financial years)
   - Consolidated bank balances across the Group

3. **Computer Expenses Investigation**:
   - Attached schedule of computer expenses allocated by Rynette (March-April 2025)
   - Requests Dan provide:
     * Description of each expense in layman's terms
     * Current or future business application
     * SARS justification as "in the production of income"
   - States: "I'm expecting SARS to audit our computer expenses claimed for tax"

### Critical Analysis

**False Impartiality**:
- Claims to maintain impartiality
- Already received trustee appointment from Peter/Rynette (August 11)
- Already coordinating with Rynette on computer expenses
- **16 days after receiving trustee appointment**, claims impartiality

**"Regima Group of Companies" Framing**:
- Bantjies uses "Regima Group of Companies" terminology
- Continues deceptive group framing despite separate legal entities
- Facilitates profit extraction and expense dumping concealment

**Rynette as Information Source**:
- Computer expenses "allocated by Rynette"
- Bantjies relies on Rynette's allocations
- No independent verification of expense allocations
- Rynette controls what Bantjies sees

**SARS Audit Threat**:
- "I'm expecting SARS to audit our computer expenses"
- Creates pressure on Dan to justify expenses
- Follows pattern of using external threats (SARS, medical testing, legal action)
- Computer expenses already weaponized in June 10 email

**Timing Significance**:
- August 11: Trustee appointment signed and sent
- August 27: Bantjies requests computer expense justification
- **16-day gap**: Time for coordination between Peter/Rynette/Bantjies

**Addressees**:
- "Dear Jacqui, Danny and Peter"
- Dan forwarding to Jax via personal email (jfaucitt@proton.me)
- Suggests Dan's regima.zone email may be compromised or monitored
- Use of personal/backup channels for communication
