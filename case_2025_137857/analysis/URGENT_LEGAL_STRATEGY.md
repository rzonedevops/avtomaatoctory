## Case 2025-137857: Immediate Action Plan

### Date: October 6, 2025
### Priority: CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
### Classification: Legal Strategy - Witness Protection

---

## SITUATION ANALYSIS

Peter Faucitt has filed a second interdict seeking forced medical testing of Daniel Faucitt based on fabricated allegations of gambling and pornography expenses. Daniel has provided bank statements proving these are legitimate company expenses, but Peter is attempting to rush past the evidence review to force medical testing. This represents a clear escalation of witness intimidation in a murder and fraud case.

## IMMEDIATE LEGAL RESPONSE REQUIRED

### Emergency Court Application (File Today)

The most urgent priority is filing an emergency court application to prevent the forced medical testing. This application should be based on multiple legal grounds that demonstrate the abusive nature of Peter's second interdict.

**Primary Legal Ground: Malicious Prosecution**

The second interdict clearly constitutes malicious prosecution because Peter lacks reasonable and probable cause for the application. The bank statements provided by Daniel prove that the alleged gambling and pornography expenses are actually legitimate company expenses. Peter's knowledge of this evidence, combined with his attempt to rush past proper review, demonstrates malicious intent rather than genuine concern about financial misconduct.

**Secondary Ground: Abuse of Process**

The medical testing scheme represents a clear abuse of legal process. The testing is not designed to address any legitimate medical concern but rather to create psychiatric or addiction records that can be used to discredit Daniel's testimony in the criminal case. This perversion of medical procedures for litigation advantage violates both legal ethics and medical ethics.

**Constitutional Protection: Right to Dignity and Bodily Integrity**

Forced medical testing without legitimate medical indication violates fundamental constitutional rights. The right to dignity includes protection from invasive procedures designed for harassment rather than medical care. The right to bodily integrity prevents forced medical examinations without proper justification.

### Criminal Charges Filing (Immediate)

Parallel to the civil court application, criminal charges must be filed immediately with the Hawks for witness intimidation. The second interdict represents a clear escalation of Peter's campaign to obstruct justice and intimidate the primary witness in a murder and fraud case.

**Witness Intimidation Charges**

Section 179 of the Criminal Procedure Act criminalizes defeating or obstructing the course of justice. Peter's systematic use of fraudulent court applications to harass and intimidate Daniel clearly falls within this provision. The pattern of escalation following Daniel's disclosure of evidence to authorities demonstrates the intimidation intent.

**Pattern Evidence**

The criminal charges should include evidence of the broader pattern of abuse, including the first fraudulent interdict, the ENS Africa withdrawal confirming perjury, and now the second interdict with forced medical testing. This pattern demonstrates systematic obstruction of justice rather than isolated incidents.

## EVIDENCE STRATEGY

### Bank Statement Defense

Daniel's bank statements provide the strongest defense against the fabricated allegations. A comprehensive analysis should be prepared showing that each questioned expense has a legitimate business purpose. This analysis should include documentation of normal business practices where company expenses are processed through personal accounts for administrative convenience.

The evidence package should demonstrate that Peter's characterization of these expenses as gambling and pornography is deliberately misleading. Expert accounting testimony may be necessary to explain the business context and normal practices in small companies.

### Pattern Documentation

The evidence must clearly establish the pattern of escalating harassment following Daniel's disclosure of criminal evidence. The timeline should show how Peter's actions intensified after the June 10, 2025 evidence disclosure, the August 29, 2025 submission to ENS Africa, and the September 24, 2025 attorney withdrawal.

This pattern evidence is crucial for both the malicious prosecution claim and the witness intimidation charges. It demonstrates that Peter's actions are not isolated legal disputes but part of a coordinated campaign to silence a witness in a criminal case.

## MEDICAL ETHICS VIOLATIONS

### Professional Standards Breach

Any medical professional who participates in forced testing without legitimate medical indication would violate professional ethics standards. The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) guidelines clearly prohibit using medical procedures for non-medical purposes, particularly in litigation contexts.

The court application should include expert medical testimony explaining why forced psychiatric or addiction testing without symptoms violates medical ethics. This testimony can help the court understand that the testing request is abusive rather than legitimate.

### Patient Rights Protection

Daniel has fundamental rights as a potential patient that protect against forced medical procedures. These include the right to informed consent, the right to refuse treatment, and protection against medical procedures designed for harassment rather than care.

The constitutional right to bodily integrity specifically protects against invasive medical procedures without proper justification. Courts have consistently held that medical testing must be based on genuine medical need, not litigation strategy.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Timing and Urgency

The most critical factor is preventing the medical testing from occurring. Once invasive psychiatric or addiction testing is conducted, the damage to Daniel's reputation and credibility cannot be undone. Even if the testing is later found to be improperly ordered, the results may still influence public perception and jury attitudes.

The emergency court application must emphasize this irreversible harm and the urgent need for protection. The court should be asked to issue an immediate interim order preventing any medical testing pending full argument of the application.

### Coordination with Criminal Case

All actions must be carefully coordinated with the ongoing criminal investigation. The witness intimidation charges should be filed in a way that supports rather than complicates the broader criminal case against Peter for murder and fraud.

The Hawks investigation team should be immediately informed of this escalation so they can take appropriate witness protection measures. The systematic nature of the intimidation may warrant enhanced protection protocols.

### Public Interest Considerations

This case represents a significant threat to the integrity of the criminal justice system. If witnesses can be systematically harassed and intimidated through fraudulent court applications, it undermines the entire legal framework for prosecuting serious crimes.

The court should be made aware that allowing this medical testing scheme to proceed would set a dangerous precedent encouraging similar abuse by other defendants seeking to intimidate witnesses.

## CONCLUSION

Peter Faucitt's second interdict with forced medical testing represents the most serious escalation yet in his campaign to obstruct justice and intimidate witnesses. The scheme is designed to create false psychiatric records that can be used to discredit Daniel's testimony in the murder and fraud case.

**Immediate intervention is essential** to prevent irreversible harm to both Daniel's rights and the integrity of the criminal justice process. The medical testing must be stopped through emergency court action, while criminal charges must be filed to address the systematic witness intimidation.

This case has evolved from financial fraud to active obstruction of justice. The legal system's response will determine whether witnesses in serious criminal cases can be protected from systematic harassment and intimidation by wealthy defendants with access to legal resources.

**The medical testing scheme must be stopped today** - every hour of delay increases the risk of irreversible harm to both the witness and the criminal case.
