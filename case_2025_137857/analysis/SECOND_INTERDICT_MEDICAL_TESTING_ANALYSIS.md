## MEDICAL TESTING SCHEME ANALYSIS

### 1. The Discrediting Strategy

**Objective**: Portray Daniel as mentally unstable or addicted
**Method**: Force psychiatric/addiction evaluation
**Goal**: Undermine credibility as witness in criminal case
**Legal Basis**: Fabricated financial misconduct allegations

### 2. Fabricated Allegations Analysis

**Peter's Claims**: Daniel spent company money on gambling and pornography

**Reality**: Standard business expenses being mischaracterized

**Critical Evidence**:
- Daniel provided bank statements proving legitimate expenses
- Company expenses on personal account is normal business practice
- Peter attempting to "rush past" evidence review
- Medical testing sought before financial evidence examined

### 3. Procedural Manipulation

**Peter's Strategy**:
- File second interdict with inflammatory allegations
- Seek urgent medical testing before evidence review
- Use testing results to discredit Daniel's testimony
- Prevent proper examination of bank statement evidence

**Legal Problems**:
- No medical evidence supporting testing need
- Financial allegations already disproven by bank records
- Urgent application lacks genuine urgency
- Designed to circumvent proper evidence evaluation
