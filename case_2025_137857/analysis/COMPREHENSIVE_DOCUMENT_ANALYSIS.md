- Verifying whether intended recipients actually received messages
- Confirming knowledge through independent evidence

**Application to Case 2025-137857**:
The verification tracker system may be intended to address specific issues in this case, including:
- Email channel control disputes
- Knowledge verification for key communications
- Evidence of communication interception
- Confirmation of actual receipt versus claimed receipt
