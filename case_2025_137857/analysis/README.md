- "Fiat lux" clause system allows any professional to cash out indefinitely
- System designed to pathologize resistance to criminal demands
- Creates medical servitude where victim must submit to any procedure deemed "necessary"

### 2. Weaponized Medical Testing Mechanism  
**File**: `WEAPONIZED_MEDICAL_TESTING_MECHANISM.md`

**Summary**: Detailed examination of how medical testing is systematically weaponized through arbitrary expert conclusions, where any disagreement with Peter Faucitt's demands is transformed into evidence of mental illness or behavioral defect.

**Key Findings**:
- Normal responses to abuse are pathologized by professional decree
- Only complete surrender to Peter's demands provides "clean bill of mental health"
- Medical authority corrupted to serve legal intimidation purposes
- Creates medical authoritarianism where resistance becomes pathological

**File**: `CURATORSHIP_SCAM_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md`

**Summary**: Comprehensive analysis revealing the ultimate criminal objective: systematic orchestration of conditions for curatorship application over Daniel and Jacqueline Faucitt. Exposes how chaos creation, record destruction, and forced medical testing work together as evidence manufacturing for incapacity claims.

**Key Findings**:
- Medical testing was evidence manufacturing for future curatorship application
- Systematic coordination between Peter Faucitt, Rynette Farrar, and Danie Bantjies
- Creation of chaos and destruction of records to simulate "incapacity"
- Ultimate goal: total legal control through curatorship to eliminate witness testimony and legitimize asset theft

## The Complete Criminal Scheme

### Phase 1: The Trojan Horse Setup
1. **September 2, 2025**: Elliott Attorneys propose medical testing as "mediation condition"
2. **September 2025**: Settlement forced under duress of medical testing threats
3. **Settlement Structure**: No clear limitations, vague language allowing infinite expansion

### Phase 2: The Vending Machine Activation
1. **October 2025**: Second interdict filed despite contradictory evidence
2. **Medical Testing Demanded**: Before evidence review, proving predetermined outcome  
3. **Arbitrary Conclusions**: Professional opinions become weapons of control

### Phase 3: The Enforcement Mechanism
1. **Compliance Path**: Complete surrender = clean mental health bill
2. **Resistance Path**: Any questioning = pathology requiring treatment
3. **Financial Extraction**: Endless procedures at victim's cost until compliance achieved

### Phase 4: The Curatorship Endgame (NEWLY IDENTIFIED)
1. **Evidence Manufacturing**: Use forced medical evaluations as proof of incapacity
2. **Curatorship Application**: Legal guardianship based on orchestrated "evidence"
3. **Total Control Achievement**: Complete authority over assets, communications, and decisions
4. **Witness Elimination**: Incapacitated persons cannot effectively testify in criminal cases
