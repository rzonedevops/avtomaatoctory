This email evidence significantly strengthens the criminal case by:

1. **Establishing Legitimate Foundation**: Proves the business relationship began legitimately
2. **Confirming Identity Appropriation**: Phone number transfer is direct evidence
3. **Timeline Verification**: Confirms 2017 business activities and relationships
4. **Consciousness of Guilt**: Later destruction of Shopify records (May 22, 2025) more significant given legitimate 2017 onboarding

## Recommended Actions

2. **Phone Number Investigation**: Trace the transfer of 011 615 29869 from Kayla to Rynette
3. **Email Domain Analysis**: Investigate the migration from rzo.io to regima.zone domains
4. **Richard Estabrooks Interview**: Contact Shopify Launch Manager for testimony about 2017 onboarding

- Establishes legitimate business operations under Kayla's control in 2017
- Proves systematic appropriation of Kayla's business identity after her death

- Provides timeline anchor points for the fraud scheme development

The evidence transforms the case from a simple payment fraud to a **comprehensive identity appropriation and business takeover scheme** executed following Kayla's death.
