# Investigation Findings Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains investigation findings and discoveries from case analysis,
including evidence discoveries, pattern analysis, and anomaly detection results.

## Document Types

### Evidence Findings
Documents that detail discovered evidence and its significance.

**Examples:**
- Evidence discovery reports
- Evidence assessment findings
- Material evidence identification
- Evidence chain analysis

### Pattern Analysis
Documents identifying patterns and trends in case data.

**Examples:**
- Behavioral pattern findings
- Transaction pattern analysis
- Communication pattern discoveries
- Timeline pattern identification

### Anomaly Detection
Documents highlighting anomalies and irregularities.

**Examples:**
- Financial anomalies
- Timeline inconsistencies
- Evidence gaps
- Suspicious patterns

### Relationship Findings
Documents mapping relationships between entities.

**Examples:**
- Entity relationship discoveries
- Network analysis findings
- Connection mapping
- Influence analysis

## Document Structure

All findings documents should include:

```markdown

## Naming Convention

- `[CASE_ID]_finding_[TOPIC]_[DATE].md` - Case-specific findings
- `[SYSTEM]_findings_[DATE].md` - System-wide findings
- `pattern_analysis_[TOPIC]_[DATE].md` - Pattern analysis
- `anomaly_[TOPIC]_[DATE].md` - Anomaly reports

## Quality Standards

Findings must be:
