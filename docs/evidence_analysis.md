## Evidence Analysis

3. **Timing Coordination:** Multiple emails on same day suggesting coordinated effort
4. **Mailbox Flooding:** Potential attempt to hide evidence through email overload

### Document Evidence

- **Multiple EML files:** Email chain showing progression of fraud attempt
- **Letterhead Usage:** RegimA Worldwide letterhead used to legitimize fraudulent request

### Red Flags
1. Account change effective "immediately" without proper authorization
2. Warning to stop payments to previous account
3. Only Rynette has access to new account
4. Coordinated email campaign across multiple recipients
5. Use of company letterhead for unauthorized changes

## Financial Impact Assessment
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Potential Loss:** All incoming payments diverted to unauthorized account
- **Expense Liability:** Company remains liable for expenses in original account
- **Duration:** From April 14, 2025 onwards until fraud detected

## Recommended Actions
1. Immediate freeze of new ABSA account 4112318747
2. Alert all clients to ignore bank change instructions
3. Investigate Rynette Farrar's authorization level
4. Review all payments made to new account since April 14, 2025
5. Implement additional authorization controls for bank account changes

## Legal Considerations
- Potential charges: Fraud, theft, unauthorized use of company documents
- Civil recovery: All funds diverted to unauthorized account
- Corporate governance: Review of authorization procedures needed
