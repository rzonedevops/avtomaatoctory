- The murder of Kayla Pretorius in August 2023
- Misappropriation of funds belonging to the deceased's company

1.2 This email explicitly mentioned "Kayla's murder" and described the misappropriation as "theft" and "fraudulent."

- Ex turpi causa non oritur actio - no action can arise from an illegal cause
