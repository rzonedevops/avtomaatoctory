**ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

I, the undersigned

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

1.  I am a major female businessman residing at 20 Rive Road, Morning
    Hill, Bedfordview. I am cited as the First Respondent in this
    application.

2.  The facts contained herein are, save where otherwise stated or where
    the context indicates otherwise, within my own personal knowledge
    and are to the best of my belief both true and correct.

**[PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT]{.underline}**

3.  I have read the founding affidavit deposed to by the Applicant, my
    husband, and I respond thereto as set out below. Insofar as I do not
    specifically deal with any of the allegations made by the Applicant
    in the founding papers, they are denied.

4.  I depose to this affidavit for the anticipation of an *ex parte*
    order alternatively for the reconsideration of the *ex parte* order
    which was granted against myself and the my son, Daniel Faucitt (the
    Second Respondent) on 19 August 2025. A copy of this order is
    attached marked "**JF1**".

5.  In this regard, and as I will demonstrate below, the Applicant has
    abused the process of this Honourable Court by surreptitiously
    obtaining an *ex parte* order against my son and I in terms of which
    we were essentially "locked out" of our own businesses so that the
    Applicant could take full control of the management of the
    businesses.

6.  To this end, and as will also be demonstrated below, neither I nor
    the Second Respondent have misappropriated the funds of the business
    and that, contrary to what the Applicant contends, the "rot" in the
    business that needs to be stopped is the unlawful conduct by the
    businesses bookkeeper, Rynette Farrar ("Rynette"), who has
    misappropriated company funds and taken full control over the
    various business entities.

7.  I believe that Rynette has sought to provide inaccurate information to the Applicant
    believing that I and the Second Respondent have caused the
    businesses to allegedly suffer and has manipulated the Applicant to
    turn against us.

8.  It bears mentioning that the Applicant is very impressionable and
    can be manipulated easily. His memory, reasoning, and judgment have
    deteriorated, and I believe he may be exhibiting signs consistent
    with early-onset dementia. Furthermore, I believe that he is having
    an extra-marital affair with Rynette and that they are conspiring
    together to exclude me and the Second Respondent from the
    businesses.

9.  Apart from the above, I will also show that neither I nor the Second
    Respondent have conducted ourselves recklessly and there is no
    support for the allegations made in the application concerning our
    alleged financial mismanagement of the businesses. Any mismanagement
    has been carried out by Rynette, and possibly by also the Applicant,
    who have sought to exploit corporate opportunities for themselves
    and transfer all the business of the entities to new companies.

10. I am advised that this conduct constitutes a breach of the
    Applicant's fiduciary duties as a director and that, in so far as
    Rynette is concerned, her conduct [constitutes theft and
    fraud]{.mark}. I will show the above Honourable Court, based on
    information that recently came to light, that Rynette is conducting
    herself in this manner.

11. At the outset I set out the background to this application and
    thereafter, I provide a sequential response to the allegations made
    in the founding affidavit. Lastly, I will explain why this
    Honourable Court ought to set aside, alternatively, reconsider and
    set aside, the *ex parte* order that was granted.

**[BACKGROUND]{.underline}**

12. The Applicant, along with myself and the Second Respondent are all
    directors and/or members of the Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth
    Respondent. These businesses form part of RegimA group of companies,
    which forms part of the family's business operations.

13. The businesses in question are primarily engaged in the manufacture,
    marketing, and international distribution of skincare and cosmetic
    products developed under the "RegimA" brand. This brand of skincare
    products are sold to medical practitioners, both in South Africa and
    in the United Kingdom, to treat medical conditions such as severe
    scaring.

14. In this regard, the various director searches are attached marked
    "**JF2**", "**JF3"** and "**JF4**".

15. These searches evidence that all three of us are reflected as
    directors and/or members in the following entities:

    1.  RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (the Third Respondent)
        -- Registration Number 2011/005722/07; and

    2.  Strategic Logistics CC (the Sixth Respondent) -- Registration
        Number 2008/136496/23.

16. These two entities form the core of the RegimA business structure,
    and are instrumental in the import, export, and distribution
    functions of the brand. However, it is critical to note that following
    the 2016 incident where the Applicant forcibly ejected the Second
    Respondent and myself from the business premises, confiscated our
    equipment, and declared "you're on your own now," the Second Respondent
    and I were forced to build our own independent e-commerce operations
    from scratch. From 2016-2019, we operated entirely independently from
    our residential property, incorporating multiple entities including
    Unicorn Dynamics (Pty) Ltd (2016), ReZonance (Pty) Ltd (2017), and
    RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd (2017), which achieved Shopify Plus enterprise
    status and generated substantial independent revenue.

17. In addition to the above, the Applicant and I are further reflected
    as co-members and/or directors of several other business entities,
    being:

    1.  Aymac International CC -- Registration Number 1999/061687/23;

    2.  Corpclo 2065 CC -- Registration Number 2003/086391/23;

    3.  Corpclo 2304 CC -- Registration Number 2005/014378/23;

    4.  RegimA International Skin Treatments CC -- Registration Number
        2008/127748/23;

    5.  RegimA Skin Treatments CC (the Fourth Respondent) --
        Registration Number 1992/005371/23;

    6.  RegimA Spazone (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2017/081833/07;
        and

    7.  Villa Via Arcadia No. 2 CC (the Fifth Respondent) --
        Registration Number 1996/004451/23.

18. These entities were established at various times to manage distinct
    aspects of the RegimA operations, including research and
    development, local distribution, property holdings, and licensing
    arrangements.

19. Our son, the Second Respondent, has in more recent years been
    appointed as a director of a number of related and subsidiary
    entities associated with the RegimA brand, namely:

    1.  RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2017/110437/07;

    2.  RegimA Zone Academy (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number
        2017/113134/07;

## MY ROLE AS REGULATORY RESPONSIBLE PERSON

It is crucial for this Honourable Court to understand that I am not
merely an \"administrative assistant\" as the Applicant may suggest, but
rather serve as the legally designated \"Responsible Person\" for RegimA
International Skin Treatments across 37 international jurisdictions.\
\
This designation is not administrative but a strict regulatory
requirement under international cosmetics and skin treatment
regulations, particularly EU and UK Cosmetics Regulations. As
Responsible Person, I bear personal legal liability and regulatory
authority that cannot be delegated or transferred without regulatory
approval.\
\
My responsibilities as Responsible Person include:\
- Product Information Filing and Cosmetic Product Notifications (CPNP)\
- Toxicology studies and safety assessments oversight\
- Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance\
- Regulatory liaison with authorities in 37 jurisdictions\
- Continuous market surveillance and safety monitoring\
\
The ex parte interdict has effectively excluded someone with critical
regulatory duties from the business operations. This creates serious
compliance risks as the businesses cannot legally operate in these 37
jurisdictions without the designated Responsible Person\'s involvement.\
\
This regulatory role demonstrates not only my legitimate operational
authority but also my expertise and capability, as trusted by 37
different regulatory bodies internationally. Any suggestion that I lack
capacity or authority is directly contradicted by these extensive
regulatory responsibilities.

3.  RegimA Zone Impact (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2017/109415/07;

4.  RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2017/087935/07;

5.  RegimA Medic (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2017/087877/07;

6.  Unicorn Dynamics (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2016/307425/07;

7.  Rezonance (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2017/081396/07 (currently
    in deregistration process);

8.  Jozi Way Trading (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2016/240702/07
    (currently in deregistration process); and

9.  Pandamania (Pty) Ltd -- Registration Number 2021/306676/07 (under
    restoration process).

20. These entities are either operationally or historically linked to
    the RegimA group and its associated business ventures. The Second
    Respondent's appointment in many of these companies illustrates his
    increased participation in the management and business affairs of
    the family's corporate interests.

21. The significance of these overlapping directorships must be understood
    in proper historical context. Following the 2016 forced separation, the
    Second Respondent and I developed completely independent business operations,
    incorporating five separate entities (Unicorn Dynamics, ReZonance, RegimA
    Zone, RegimA Zone Academy, and RegimA Zone Impact) from 2016-2017. These
    independent small entities, built from scratch through our own e-commerce
    platform strategy, surpassed existing services and took over infrastructure
    through automation during the lockdown period. The Applicant cannot now
    claim ownership of businesses he forced the Second Respondent to build 
    independently after ejecting him and stripping his resources.

21A. It is crucial to understand the Second Respondent's perspective on the
    2016 events and subsequent independent business building. As the Second
    Respondent has recalled, the events of 2016 present a deeply ironic
    situation where the Second Respondent advocated for technology-driven 
    business advancement and modernisation, while the Applicant adamantly 
    argued that such technological investment was too expensive and unnecessary.
    This disagreement over technology strategy led to the Second Respondent's 
    forced ejection, with the Applicant effectively declaring "you're on your 
    own" and stripping him of all business resources. Following this forced 
    separation, while others suggested pursuing traditional legal remedies such 
    as CCMA proceedings for wrongful dismissal, the Second Respondent took a
    different strategic approach. He decided to build his ideas in parallel
    with existing systems and demonstrate their superiority through performance
    rather than litigation. This approach proved highly successful and
    ultimately vindicated the Second Respondent's forward-thinking position
    that technology was indeed the correct path for business growth.

21B. The Second Respondent, having designed and architected nearly every
    operational system in use within the original RegimA operations, possessed
    the exceptional technical expertise necessary to create entirely new systems
    and parallel strategies to evaluate relative performance. His educational
    background in Electronic Engineering and Applied Mathematics, combined with
    extensive practical experience in system design and implementation, enabled
    him to architect sophisticated e-commerce platforms from scratch that would
    ultimately prove superior to existing systems. The Second Respondent's
    technical capabilities are so comprehensive that he has consistently maintained
    he has no objection to the Applicant taking whatever systems he likes from
    the original operations, as his ability to build superior alternatives from
    first principles makes such appropriation irrelevant to his own business
    success.

21C. However, a critical issue has emerged that demonstrates the Applicant's
    deliberate and systematic interference with the Second Respondent's legitimate
    business activities. Despite the Second Respondent funding all Shopify platform
    operations entirely through his own companies' resources and personal funds,
    the Applicant has specifically instructed warehouse personnel to cease
    fulfilling any orders from the Second Respondent's Shopify platforms. This
    warehouse sabotage instruction affects massive business operations generating
    R 34.9M+ annually, including RegimA SA (25 Shopify stores generating R 8.5M
    annually), RegimA Zone (26 Shopify stores generating R 26.4M annually), and
    RegimA Worldwide Distribution operations (with peak revenue of R 19.8M).
    This represents comprehensive evidence of deliberate and systematic sabotage
    of legitimate business operations that were built and funded entirely
    independently by the Second Respondent, demonstrating the Applicant's
    ongoing business interference despite having no legitimate claim to these
    independently created revenue streams.

21D. The core issue, as the Second Respondent has clearly articulated, is that
    the Applicant is systematically taking actions to prevent the Second
    Respondent from engaging in any productive work or legitimate business
    activity whatsoever. The Applicant is restraining the Second Respondent
    as a "captive beneficiary" - unable to participate freely in the competitive
    economy while simultaneously being subjected to various forms of abuse,
    manipulation, and systematic harassment by malicious trustees. The Second
    Respondent's position is straightforward: all he requires is the basic
    freedom to participate in the competitive economy like any other entrepreneur
    or business professional, without being constantly attacked, undermined,
    and sabotaged by malicious trustees who are acting without legitimate
    reason, proper authority, or legal justification for their systematic
    interference with his legitimate business activities.

21E. The success of the Second Respondent's independent approach has been
    thoroughly and definitively demonstrated. The strategic decision to build
    superior technology-driven solutions rather than engaging in protracted
    litigation proved to be entirely correct and highly profitable. The
    independent businesses not only achieved prestigious Shopify Plus enterprise
    status within one year of operation but generated substantial revenue streams
    that significantly surpassed the original operations in both operational
    efficiency and profitability. This remarkable success completely validates
    the Second Respondent's original position in 2016 that technology investment
    and digital transformation were indeed the correct path forward for business
    growth, directly contradicting the Applicant's short-sighted cost-focused
    objections. The Applicant's current attempts to appropriate these highly
    successful independent operations represent a particularly vindictive and
    opportunistic effort to punish the Second Respondent for conclusively
    proving him wrong about technology investment strategy and for building
    businesses that exceeded all expectations despite being forced to start
    from scratch with no resources.

22. Notwithstanding the above, I record that all three of us have, over
    the years, been integrally involved in the operations of the RegimA
    group of companies. However, in practice, the Second Respondent and
    I have assumed the primary responsibility for the day-to-day running
    of the businesses.

23. The Second Respondent and I have, for a considerable period, managed
    and overseen the daily operations, financial administration, and
    compliance functions of the companies. We have ensured that the
    businesses are conducted lawfully, efficiently, and in accordance
    with the provisions of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 ("the Companies
    Act"). We have at all times acted in good faith, exercised proper
    control over financial and operational matters, and discharged our
    fiduciary duties diligently and honestly.

24. The Applicant, on the other hand, has not been involved in the
    administrative or operational affairs of the companies for many
    years. The Applicant is not computer literate and does not have
    access to, or understanding of, the electronic accounting systems,
    online banking platforms, or digital reporting mechanisms that
    underpin the management of the businesses. All administrative,
    financial, and compliance-related functions (including
    correspondence with accountants, SARS, and service providers) are
    handled exclusively by the Second Respondent and myself.

25. The Applicant's role in the companies has in recent years been
    nominal and non-executive in nature, limited primarily to historical
    association. He is no longer participates in strategic meetings,
    financial planning, or operational decision-making, and has not been
    involved in the preparation or approval of management accounts,
    stock records, or corporate filings.

26. Based on my personal interactions and observations over an extended
    period, I have become increasingly concerned about the Applicant's
    cognitive capacity and ability to make sound decisions. His memory,
    reasoning, and judgment have, in my opinion, noticeably deteriorated
    over time (the Applicant is currently 72 years old), and I believe
    that he may be exhibiting signs consistent with early-onset
    dementia.

27. The Applicant displays severe confusion at times regarding simple
    matters and is erratic in his decision making. He has, to a large
    extent, given Rynette free reign to run the businesses which the
    Second Respondent and I have taken issue with. Rynette has access to
    all the Applicant's passwords and login details to the various
    financial software used in the various businesses.

28. Rynette is able to unilaterally, and without needing the approval of
    the Applicant, myself or the Second Respondent, email customers and
    transfer funds. She has unfettered access to all of the books of
    account as well as customer lists and bank accounts.

29. With this said, the Applicant is computer illiterate and lacks the
    requisite ability to perform administrative or financial functions
    independently. He views a computer as being nothing more than a
    paperweight. As a result, any work that he purports to undertake in
    relation to the companies' affairs is, in truth, executed by
    Rynette, who prepares, manages, and transmits such documents on his
    behalf. He has effectively given Rynette direct control and access
    over company records, correspondence, and financial documentation,
    further blurring the lines between her professional duties and the
    Applicant's personal reliance on her.

30. The reliance placed on Rynette by the Applicant as well as the
    ability to do as she pleases in the affairs of the company, have
    created an increasingly unstable working environment. The Second
    Respondent and I would often confront the Applicant about the trust
    he places in Rynette, however, the Applicant would tell us that
    there is nothing wrong with Rynette having unfettered access to the
    businesses.

31. To make things worse, I believe that the Applicant has started an
    extra-marital affair with Rynette and that she has been manipulating
    him to gain access to the businesses so as to misappropriate the
    corporate opportunities. As at the date of deposing to this
    affidavit, Rynette has access to each and every account in the
    businesses.

32. The Second Respondent and I believe that Rynette will do everything
    in her power to ensure that she remains in control of the businesses
    and that her fraud is not uncovered.

32A. The systematic nature of the Applicant's interference with legitimate
    business operations extends far beyond mere financial manipulation and
    represents a comprehensive campaign of business sabotage. The most egregious
    example is the Applicant's specific instruction to warehouse personnel to
    cease fulfilling any orders for the Second Respondent's Shopify platforms,
    despite these operations being funded entirely through the Second Respondent's
    own companies and personal resources without any financial contribution
    from the Applicant whatsoever. This deliberate warehouse sabotage has
    directly affected operations generating R 34.9M+ annually across multiple
    platforms and represents a calculated attempt to systematically cripple
    the Second Respondent's independent business activities. The Applicant is
    cynically exploiting his residual influence over shared logistics infrastructure
    to prevent the Second Respondent from conducting legitimate commerce,
    effectively implementing a strategy of holding him captive within the
    business structure while simultaneously preventing him from operating
    independently or generating revenue through his own entrepreneurial efforts.
    This constitutes ongoing business interference of the most serious nature.

33. The above circumstances have created an increasingly unstable
    working environment, which the Second Respondent which I have
    attempted to manage. Notwithstanding these difficulties, we have
    continued to conduct ourselves with integrity, prioritising the
    business' interests, the staff's wellbeing, and compliance with all
    statutory and fiduciary obligations. We have certainly not conducted
    ourselves in an improper manner.

**[THE INTERDICT GRANTED ON 19 AUGUST 2025 BEFORE THE HONOURABLE JUSTICE
KUMALO]{.underline}**

34. On 19 August 2025, the Applicant approached this Honourable Court
    and obtained an urgent *ex parte* interim order against myself and
    the Second Respondent. The application was brought without any
    notice to us, and we were therefore denied the opportunity to place
    material facts before the Court which, had they been disclosed,
    would have demonstrated that the relief sought was both unnecessary
    and unjustified.

35. In terms of the said interim order, we were, *inter alia*:

    1.  Interdicted and directed to surrender all bank cards and access
        devices relating to the Third to Sixth Respondents, being
        companies forming part of the RegimA group of entities;

    2.  Interdicted and restrained from opening, operating, or having
        access to any other bank accounts in the names of the Third to
        Sixth Respondents;

    3.  Interdicted and prohibited from dealing in any way with the
        management, administration, or day-to-day operations of the
        Third to Sixth Respondents; and

    4.  Interdicted and excluded from participating in or contributing
        to the forensic investigation which the Applicant has
        purportedly initiated in respect of the same companies.

36. The Applicant's approach in seeking such extensive and punitive
    relief on an *ex parte* basis constitutes, in my respectful view, a
    gross abuse of the court process. The application was brought under
    the guise of urgency and necessity, yet no factual or legal basis
    existed for the drastic order that was granted against us.

37. It bears emphasis that, for many years, the Second Respondent and I
    have been the individuals responsible for the practical, financial,
    and administrative management of the companies. We oversee staff,
    suppliers, customer relations, and compliance. The Applicant has, by
    contrast, had no meaningful involvement in these functions, as she
    is not computer literate, lacks the requisite understanding of
    financial systems, and has not participated in operational
    decision-making for a considerable time.

38. The granting of order has therefore had severe and far-reaching
    consequences. It has effectively paralysed the ongoing operations of
    the companies and created instability within the businesses,
    resulting in delays in supplier payments, payroll difficulties, and
    disruption to client orders and export commitments. The employees
    and trading partners of the RegimA group have been left in a state
    of uncertainty and distress.

39. As a result thereof, I and the Second Respondent have been locked
    out of the businesses and the Applicant essentially has essentially
    taken over the businesses. His actions are, in my respectful view,
    motivated by personal animosity and an intention to seize unilateral
    control of the business entities in question.

40. The urgent application was an abuse of process, designed not to
    protect the companies, but to advance the Applicant's own agenda.
    The order obtained is both unjust and oppressive, and it has
    resulted in significant prejudice to myself, the Second Respondent,
    and the employees whose livelihoods depend on the continued and
    lawful operation of the businesses.

41. I accordingly place before this Honourable Court a detailed account
    of the procedural irregularities, material non-disclosures, and
    misrepresentations contained in the Applicant's founding papers
    through *ad seriatum* response, which collectively demonstrate the
    *mala fides* underpinning her approach to this Court.

**[WHAT OCCURRED AFTER THE GRANTING OF THE INTERIM
INTERDICT]{.underline}**

42. After the interim interdict was granted, the Second Respondent and I
    appointed ENSAfrica (ENS) as our attorneys of record. Unfortunately,
    their handling of the matter was unsatisfactory and their mandate
    was terminated.

43. Rather than protecting our interests or addressing the abuse of the
    *ex parte* order, ENS arranged lengthy round-table meetings between
    ourselves and the Applicant that lasted nearly eight hours, during
    which we were pressured to settle.

44. ENS thereafter produced two draft settlement agreements, one dealing
    with a forensic audit and the other with medical testing, copies of
    which are annexed as **"JF4"** and **"JF5"**.

45. In respect of the forensic audit, the agreement records that the
    parties consented to the appointment of Forvis Mazars to conduct a
    forensic investigation into the financial affairs of the Third to
    Sixth Respondents, to examine alleged irregularities in payments and
    financial management. All parties were to cooperate with the
    investigators and answer questions honestly. The costs of the
    investigation were to be paid by the companies themselves, and
    pending the report, transactions on the company accounts were to be
    conducted transparently, with the Applicant notifying myself and the
    Second Respondent of each transaction.

46. The agreement further provided that Second Respondent would be
    reimbursed for legitimate business expenses incurred personally and
    that mediation would resume once the forensic report was delivered.
    Each party would bear their own legal costs.

47. In essence, this document sought to regulate the interim running of
    the businesses while the forensic audit was pending, but did not
    meaningfully resolve the underlying disputes or address the abuse of
    the original interdict.

48. In respect of **JF5**, this agreement provided that all three
    parties (the Applicant, myself and the Second Respondent) would
    undergo psychiatric evaluations by mid-October 2025 and drug
    screening (hair-follicle tests) by early October 2025. The
    professionals conducting the assessments were to be jointly selected
    by the parties' attorneys, or failing agreement, appointed by the
    Gauteng Family Law Forum, and each party would bear their own costs.
    The resulting reports would be furnished to the attorneys.

49. It further required strict confidentiality, prohibiting disclosure
    of the agreement or any medical reports without mutual written
    consent. The document was stated to be the sole agreement on medical
    testing, not capable of variation except in writing.

50. In summary, the agreement imposed intrusive and unnecessary testing
    obligations on all parties, including myself, under circumstances of
    significant pressure and without proper justification or judicial
    direction.

51. The aforesaid settlement agreements (**JF4** and **JF5**) were not
    entered into freely or voluntarily but under circumstances of
    sustained intimidation, coercion, and duress. At the time of
    signing, I was still (and currently) residing with the Applicant, in
    the same household, a situation that rendered me exceptionally
    vulnerable. The Applicant's conduct during this period was menacing,
    volatile, and manipulative.

52. He repeatedly told me in explicit terms that if I did not sign the
    agreements, he would "*kill me*" and "*make sure I regret it*."
    These threats were delivered in a deliberate and intimidating tone.
    They were made with the clear intention of instilling fear and
    compelling my compliance. I was terrified of him and believed that
    defying him would have immediate and possibly fatal consequences.

53. [I still do not have an interim protection order against the
    Applicant. This is not due to a lack of fear or evidence, but
    because I remain in an extremely precarious position. I have no safe
    or affordable alternative accommodation and nowhere else to go as
    the Applicant has now switched off the tap.]{.mark}

54. [The Applicant continues to reside in the same property, and I am
    effectively trapped by circumstance and fear. My greatest concern is
    that if I were to obtain a protection order resulting in his
    eviction, it would escalate his anger and provoke retaliation. Given
    his temperament and prior conduct, I have a genuine and reasonable
    fear that he would seek to harm me through others or orchestrate my
    death by indirect means. In other words, while a protection order
    might remove him physically from the property, it would likely
    heighten the danger to my life.]{.mark}

55. [As a result, I have remained in the shared home under constant
    fear, attempting to maintain peace in order to survive. My continued
    presence there is not a sign of consent, tolerance, or
    reconciliation but of necessity and fear. The Applicant's awareness
    of my lack of safe alternatives allowed him to weaponise my
    circumstances against me. Under these oppressive conditions, I was
    coerced into signing the settlement agreements against my will. Mine
    nor the Second Respondent's consent was therefore not freely and
    voluntarily given but was extracted through intimidation,
    psychological pressure, and fear for my life. The agreements are
    thus tainted by duress and coercion and must accordingly be declared
    invalid and of no force or effect.]{.mark}

56. I now reply sequentially to the allegations made in the founding
    affidavit.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 1 TO 1.3]{.underline}**

57. The contents herein are admitted in so far as it relates to the
    Applicant's identity number and address.

58. I however deny that the facts set out by the Applicant are both true
    and correct.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 2 TO 2.4]{.underline}**

59. The contents herein are admitted in so far that the Applicant has
    obtained legal advice but it is denied that he is personally and
    continuously involved with the subject matter.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 3 TO 3.10]{.underline}**

60. The contents herein are admitted in so far as the Applicant and the
    citation of the Respondents are concerned.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 3.11 TO 3.13]{.underline}**

61. The contents herein are admitted.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 4]{.underline}**

62. [I admit that this Court has jurisdiction to determine this
    matter.]{.mark}

**[AD PARAGRAPH 5]{.underline}**

63. [It is admitted that the Applicant purports to rely on section
    162(2) of the Companies Act, and that he is a director and
    shareholder of the Third Respondent, being RegimA Worldwide
    Distribution (Pty) Ltd. It is, however, denied that the Applicant is
    a *member* of the Third Respondent, as the said entity is a private
    company (Pty) Ltd and not a close corporation, and therefore does
    not have members as contemplated in the Close Corporations Act 69 of
    1984.]{.mark}

64. It is further admitted that the Applicant is a member of the Fourth
    to Sixth Respondents, which are close corporations duly registered
    in terms of the Close Corporations Act. Save as aforesaid, the
    remaining allegations are denied, and the Applicant's reliance on
    section 162 [is contrived,]{.mark} as the statutory grounds for
    delinquency or probation are not met on any factual or legal basis.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 6 TO 6.5]{.underline}**

65. The contents herein are admitted.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7 TO 7.1]{.underline}**

66. The contents herein are admitted in so far that Daniel Bantjies
    ("Daniel") attended the corporations office for various tax-related
    admin. Save for the remainder and his confirmatory, I deny its
    truthfulness thereto.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.2 TO 7.5]{.underline}**

67. The contents of these paragraphs are denied. The alleged
    discrepancies and irregular payments referred to by the Applicant
    are entirely misconstrued and not supported by evidence -- same will be discussed
    below when the Second Respondent's bank statements. All payments
    made through the companies' banking accounts were legitimate
    business expenses, duly authorised in the ordinary course of
    operations, and supported by proper documentation and accounting
    records.

68. The Applicant's suggestion that these payments were suspicious or
    unexplained is false. The payments in question related primarily to
    Information Technology (IT) systems and infrastructure (including
    web services, hardware maintenance, software subscriptions, data
    security, and system upgrades) all of which were integral to the
    efficient running of the RegimA group. These expenses were routine,
    properly budgeted, and fully traceable within the companies'
    financial systems.

69. It is denied that the Second Respondent, Daniel Faucitt, has been
    erratic in any way. On the contrary, Daniel is a person of
    exceptional intellect, discipline, and professionalism. He holds a
    degree in Electronic Engineering and an Honours degree in Applied
    Mathematics, and he applies these qualifications directly to his
    role within the RegimA group. His work focuses primarily on the
    numerical, technical, and systems-driven aspects of the businesses,
    including analytical modelling, IT coordination, and data
    management. He is a meticulous and methodical individual, and his
    contributions have been instrumental in ensuring the companies'
    continued efficiency and innovation.

69A. It must be emphasised that while the Second Respondent made every
    effort to explain the necessity and function of various technologies
    to the Applicant, a fundamental and critical oversight has emerged that
    demonstrates the circular and unreasonable nature of the Applicant's
    demands. The Applicant has been demanding justification for IT services
    expenses from revenue streams that are not even owned by the South African
    companies in question. The e-commerce platforms that generate the hugely
    successful online retail operations are owned and funded entirely by the
    Second Respondent's independent UK entity, RegimA Zone Ltd, which operates
    as a completely separate legal entity from the RegimA UK Group and from
    any South African operations. The Second Respondent was therefore being
    asked to justify expenses for technology infrastructure that he was already
    paying for through his own UK company - the very entity that owns the
    e-commerce platforms and makes the entire revenue stream possible in the
    first place. This represents a fundamentally flawed and circular demand
    for expense justification where the Second Respondent is being asked to
    justify costs for infrastructure he already owns and pays for independently.

70. The Applicant's attempt to characterise Daniel's conduct as erratic
    is not supported by available evidence and constitutes a deliberate effort to undermine his
    credibility and competence. The Applicant has no technical or
    mathematical expertise and therefore lacks the understanding
    necessary to appreciate Daniel's specialised role and the highly
    analytical nature of his work.

71. In regard to the cancellation of the business bank cards, this
    action was both unusual and unjustified. Despite allegedly
    discovering issues as far back as June 2025, the Applicant never
    once discussed these concerns with either myself or the Second
    Respondent. There was no communication, query, or meeting to clarify
    or investigate any supposed irregularities. Instead, the Applicant
    unilaterally cancelled the cards (including his own) without warning
    or consultation. Such conduct is not consistent with expected behavior and entirely
    inconsistent with the behaviour of a person genuinely attempting to
    resolve a legitimate concern.

72. Neither I nor the Second Respondent were ever requested to produce
    invoices or proof of expenses, as all records were readily available
    and could have been reviewed at any stage. The Applicant's failure
    to engage with us, despite his alleged concerns, demonstrates that
    this issue was manufactured after the fact to create a narrative of
    impropriety where none existed.

73. Accordingly, the allegations in these paragraphs are denied in their
    entirety. The Applicant's conduct reflects neither transparency nor
    good faith, but rather an attempt to create a paper trail of
    supposed irregularities in order to justify his later hostile and
    opportunistic actions. Both the Second Respondent and I continue to
    perform our roles with diligence, integrity, and full compliance
    with all statutory and fiduciary obligations.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.6]{.underline}**

74. The allegations in this paragraph are denied. The Second Respondent
    did not fail to account for transactions. On the contrary, **PF7**
    show the Second Respondent actively clarifying the accounts and
    seeking access to supporting documents that had been unilaterally
    restricted by the Applicant.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.7 TO 7.8]{.underline}**

75. it is admitted that certain subscriptions were halted as a result of
    the Applicant's unilateral cancellation of the relevant company bank
    cards. The Second Respondent did not, in any way, shape, or form,
    adopt a "superior" position as alleged. On the contrary, he at all
    times acted cooperatively and in good faith to resolve the
    operational disruptions caused by the Applicant's actions, as will
    be discussed more fully below.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.9 TO 7.11]{.underline}**

76. The contents hereof are **denied**. The annexure referred to as
    **PF7** does not, as alleged, confirm "all of the above." On the
    contrary, the communications contained therein demonstrate that the
    Second Respondent and his assistant repeatedly provided the
    Applicant and his representatives with the necessary information,
    documentation, and explanations regarding the company's
    subscriptions and financial transactions. The Second Respondent
    further made available his login details and administrative
    credentials to ensure that the Applicant and the relevant
    accountants could directly access all subscription and payment
    accounts. The allegation that the annexure "confirms" the
    Applicant's version is therefore false and not supported by evidence.

77. It is clear that the communications reflected in Annexure PF7 were
    not initiated upon the Applicant's instructions, but rather by the
    Second Respondent's assistant acting on his behalf to clarify and
    rectify the disruptions caused by the Applicant's unilateral
    cancellation of the company bank cards. The correspondence clearly
    reflects that the Second Respondent's office was actively engaged in
    assisting the Applicant's office and accountants to obtain
    information and continuity of company operations, not the other way
    around.

78. The contents hereof are denied. The Second Respondent did and could
    provide all relevant invoices, supporting documentation, and
    transaction records as reflected in Annexure **PF7** -- this is
    clear from the annexure itself, which include chats attaching the
    invoices, renewal confirmations, and transaction logs for the
    company's subscriptions. The Second Respondent acted transparently
    and in good faith throughout and provided full access and
    cooperation. The allegation that he failed or was unable to provide
    the relevant invoices is false and without foundation.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.12 TO 7.13]{.underline}**

79. The contents hereof are denied. It is evident from **PF7** that the
    Second Respondent engaged appropriately and transparently with staff
    members and did nothing improper. The Applicant's own version, when
    read together with the annexure, undermines his allegations. The
    Second Respondent provided the relevant documents, spreadsheets, and
    login credentials to ensure that the Applicant and his
    representatives had full access to the company's accounts and
    records.

80. It is false and not supported by evidence to allege that the Second Respondent
    elected not to provide employees or staff with access to their
    historic emails and email accounts. The Second Respondent in fact
    provided full cooperation, including his login credentials, shared
    spreadsheets, and access details to the relevant accounts, as
    evidenced by the correspondence and documents annexed to these
    proceedings. The statement that he did so "on an ad hoc basis, as it
    suited him" is a statement not supported by available evidence and contradicted by the documentary
    record. The Applicant's own annexures reflect that the Second
    Respondent engaged extensively with staff and acted transparently at
    all times. Accordingly, the Applicant's own version is entirely
    false and is not supported by the evidence.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.14 TO 7.15]{.underline}**

81. The contents herein are denied. The alleged "interference" did not
    continue as the Second Respondent fully complied with all requests
    made of him. Any suggestion that his transparency was not in the
    interests of the corporations is both illogical and ironic, as the
    Second Respondent provided all information, documents, and access
    credentials when requested. His conduct was consistent, cooperative,
    and entirely aligned with the proper administration of the entities.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.16 TO 7.17]{.underline}**

82. It is admitted that I approached the Seventh and Eighth Respondents
    to obtain replacement bank cards, as I had no knowledge or
    understanding of the reasons why the existing cards had been
    cancelled. It appeared to me to be a routine administrative step to
    request new cards once the previous ones were deactivated, and at no
    point was I made aware that any issue or allegation existed
    regarding the said accounts or their operation.

83. It is, however, categorically denied that any transactions or
    related financial matters were ever discussed with me, as alleged by
    the Applicant. The Applicant never once engaged with either myself
    or the Second Respondent on any issue concerning the accounts, the
    cards, or the financial management of the companies. There was no
    communication, meeting, or correspondence in which any such concerns
    were raised prior to the institution of these proceedings.

84. Had the Applicant acted in good faith and communicated his concerns,
    either myself or the Second Respondent would have immediately sought
    to clarify and resolve any perceived "irregularity" or
    misunderstanding. Instead, the Applicant chose to act unilaterally
    and proceeded by way of an *ex parte* application, effectively
    excluding both myself and the Second Respondent from any
    participation or opportunity to respond.

85. This conduct was calculated and strategic, and it demonstrates that
    the Applicant's intention was not to address a legitimate concern
    but to execute a hostile takeover of the companies by removing the
    very individuals who were responsible for their day-to-day
    operations and financial administration. The Applicant's actions,
    taken without notice, and in direct disregard of procedural fairness
    and corporate governance , are indicative of a deliberate attempt to
    seize control of the corporate entities through judicial means
    rather than transparent engagement.

86. Accordingly, the contents of these paragraphs are denied to the
    extent that they misrepresent the sequence of events and are
    entirely inconsistent with the Applicant's own conduct and the
    factual reality of what transpired.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 7.18 TO 7.20]{.underline}**

87. The contents herein are vehemently denied. I did not adopt any "I
    will show you" approach as alleged by the Applicant. The Applicant
    was in fact approached jointly by myself and the Second Respondent
    regarding a director's loan which the Second Respondent had
    requested. The payment of R500 000 was accordingly made as part of
    this director's loan, not as a personal "birthday gift."

88. The reference to a "birthday gift" in the transaction description
    was merely a convenient label for ease of reference in the company's
    internal payment system, and not an indication of the nature or
    purpose of the transaction. The funds were recorded and treated as a
    director's loan in accordance with proper corporate accounting
    practices, subject to repayment, and form part of the company's loan
    ledger.

89. Furthermore, it is denied that this was done without the Applicant's
    knowledge. At all times, the Applicant was aware that the Second
    Respondent drew a director's loan, and such loans have historically
    been permissible and recorded in the company's books. The
    expenditure was therefore entirely legitimate and falls squarely
    within the ambit of lawful business transactions conducted by the
    company.

90. It is reiterated that the payment was separate from the Second
    Respondent's remuneration as a director/member, and was duly
    accounted for as a loan and not an expense. To further demonstrate
    transparency, the Second Respondent's bank statements are attached
    and marked as **[ANNEXURE]{.mark}**, which clearly reflect that all
    withdrawals and expenditures by him were exclusively for legitimate
    company-related purposes.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 8 TO 8.3]{.underline}**

91. The contents hereof are denied. When examining annexures **PF9** and
    **PF10**, it is clear that the payments reflected therein relate to
    legitimate and *bona fide* business expenses incurred in the
    ordinary and lawful course of business. These expenses were duly
    authorised, properly recorded, and paid for operational purposes
    directly linked to the running and maintenance of the company's
    systems and infrastructure.

92. Furthermore, contrary to the insinuations made, none of these
    expenses were of a personal nature or improperly motivated. A review
    of the supporting documentation contained in the said annexures
    confirms that the payments were made to recognised service providers
    and suppliers for valid commercial purposes, including IT
    maintenance, accounting systems, hardware, and software support.

93. Any suggestion that the said expenses are unexplained or that there
    are almost no invoices is incorrect and not supported by evidence. Supporting
    invoices, proof of payments, and related records have either already
    been provided or can readily be substantiated through the company's
    accounting records and bank statements. As myself and the Second
    Respondent have been interdicted, we are not in possession of same
    and the Applicant will be able to find same. These transactions were
    transparent, auditable, and consistent with accepted accounting and
    tax principles.

94. Accordingly, there is no factual or legal basis for the claim that
    these expenses create "major tax problems" or were improperly
    processed. On the contrary, the documentation demonstrates that the
    payments were necessary for the effective and lawful operation of
    the business.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 8.4]{.underline}**

95. The contents hereof are admitted only to the extent that the total
    amount of R6 738 007.47 for the 2024 tax year reflects the
    legitimate business expenses incurred under this category. These
    expenses were properly recorded and accounted for in the company's
    financials, and there is nothing improper, irregular, or suspicious
    in relation thereto. Each expense was incurred in the ordinary
    course of business.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 8.5]{.underline}**

96. The contents hereof are similarly admitted to the extent that the
    total sum of R2 116 159.47 for the 2025 tax year is correct.
    However, it is denied that these amounts are questionable or
    unexplained. As stated above, the expenses are all legitimate,
    business-related disbursements that were necessary for the
    continuation of the company's operations and are substantiated by
    invoices and proof of payment.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 8.6]{.underline}**

97. The contents hereof are denied. The reference to the "birthday gift"
    is misplaced and not supported by evidence. The item in question was not a "gift"
    at all, but rather a director's loan advanced in accordance with
    standard accounting practice. Accordingly, there is nothing
    unexplainable about the said transaction or the related amounts.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 8.7]{.underline}**

98. The contents hereof are denied. While it is correct that some of the
    expenses were paid to international suppliers, these were all
    legitimate business expenditures incurred for the company's
    operational needs. These payments were including software
    subscriptions, IT infrastructure, and technical services not locally
    available. All such payments were made in the ordinary course of
    business, fully authorised, and properly recorded in the company's
    accounting records. There was nothing improper or irregular in
    respect thereof.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 8.8 TO 8.10]{.underline}**

99. The contents hereof are denied. In respect of the alleged message
    from the bank referred to as annexure **PF11**, it is noted that the
    correspondence merely indicates that approximately 80% of the
    permissible annual foreign quota had been utilised.

100. I find it particularly interesting that this alleged message was
     never raised or produced in any prior financial year, including the
     previous year when the total expenses were almost R4 000 0000
     higher, without any issue being raised by the bank or the relevant
     regulatory authorities. This sudden reliance on the message appears
     opportunistic and is not reflective of any irregular or improper
     conduct on the part of the respondents.

101. Furthermore, the corporations' funds are lawfully managed, properly
     accounted for, and at all times utilised in accordance with South
     African exchange control regulations and Reserve Bank guidelines.
     There has been no unlawful pooling or commingling of funds between
     entities beyond what is standard and permitted for operational
     efficiency.

102. The claim that the business activities are inexplicable or would
     cause serious tax implications is not evidenced and without
     factual basis. The RegimA companies have consistently maintained
     full and proper records of all business transactions, including
     cross-border payments. The foreign expenditures referenced are
     legitimate. There is thus no basis to allege any prejudice or
     detriment to the corporations.

103. The corporations are fully capable of explaining all international
     expenses to the South African Revenue Service and the South African
     Reserve Bank, should the need arise. It is further relevant to note
     that the credit cards previously used by the Second Respondent and
     myself had already been cancelled by the Applicant, which has
     materially impacted our ability to manage and process payments on
     behalf of the entities. This, too, underscores the fact that the
     allegations of financial impropriety are both misplaced and
     not supported by evidence.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 9 TO 9.3]{.underline}**

104. The contents hereof are denied. The allegation of "substantial
     financial misconduct" is not evidenced, unsubstantiated, and
     lacking any factual or evidentiary support. No act or omission on
     the part of any of the Respondents constitutes misconduct of any
     nature, whether financial or otherwise. The assertion that such
     conduct is "neither sustainable nor acceptable" is accordingly
     denied, as there is no evidence to suggest any irregularity or
     impropriety whatsoever.

105. The statement that none of the Respondents are resellers in
     technology or technological-related items or services is irrelevant
     and not supported by evidence. The expenses incurred were not contingent upon the
     respondents being resellers but rather related to operational, IT,
     and infrastructure needs essential for the functioning of the
     companies. These included costs for systems support, software
     licensing, data storage, and related business necessities, all of
     which directly benefit and relate to the Applicants' ongoing
     business activities

106. The contents hereof are denied. The expenses referred to are
     neither "unrelated to the business of the Applicant" nor personal
     in nature. Each cost item was directly linked to the legitimate and
     ongoing business operations of the entities, including accounting,
     IT maintenance, security systems, and connectivity requirements.
     The attempt to characterise these expenses as unrelated
     demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the Applicants'
     operational structure and the technical infrastructure required to
     maintain business continuity.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 9.4]{.underline}**

107. The contents hereof are denied completely. I do not, and have
     never, aided or abetted my son in any alleged misconduct
     whatsoever. The allegations of misappropriation of funds are false,
     unsubstantiated, and without any factual basis.

108. My son has at all times acted in the best interests of the company
     and has conducted himself with integrity, transparency, and
     accountability. All transactions undertaken by him were legitimate,
     properly authorised, and made in furtherance of the company's
     lawful business operations. Any suggestion to the contrary is
     baseless and is accordingly denied.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 10 TO 10.3]{.underline}**

109. The contents hereof are admitted only to the extent that they
     accurately reflect the relief sought by the Applicant under Part B
     of the notice of motion, and the fact that certain relief was
     granted under Part A. Save as aforesaid, the remaining contents are
     denied.

110. The remainder of the contents of paragraphs are vehemently denied.
     The allegations suggesting that either myself or my son have acted
     in a manner that could be characterised as delinquent, or that
     would justify any form of probationary order, are entirely
     not supported by available evidence, unsubstantiated, and without merit. At all times, both
     my son and I have acted with the utmost integrity, transparency,
     and in strict compliance with our fiduciary and statutory
     obligations as directors. Our actions have consistently been aimed
     at preserving and promoting the financial stability and operational
     continuity of the companies, rather than causing them any
     detriment.

111. It is further denied that our conduct was detrimental to any of the
     third to sixth respondent corporations, or to the Applicant
     personally. On the contrary, my son and I have devoted substantial
     time, effort, and expertise to ensure that the businesses remain
     functional, compliant, and solvent during periods of considerable
     strain -- much of which has been caused or exacerbated by the
     Applicant's own erratic and obstructive behaviour.

112. The Applicant's attempt to label our conduct as "delinquent" or to
     seek the imposition of probation is, with respect, a clear abuse of
     process designed to discredit and undermine those who have taken
     responsible measures to safeguard the interests of the companies.
     There is no evidence before this Honourable Court to support such
     serious and defamatory allegations, and they are accordingly denied
     in the strongest possible terms.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 10.4]{.underline}**

113. The contents hereof are denied. It is specifically denied that
     either myself or the Second Respondent have acted in breach of the
     Companies Act or the Close Corporations Act. At all times, we have
     conducted ourselves in full compliance with our fiduciary duties,
     statutory obligations, and the principles of good corporate
     governance. All actions taken were in the best interests of the
     companies and were done transparently, with proper authorisation,
     and in accordance with applicable legal and accounting standards.

114. The Applicant's blanket allegation of "clear contravention" is
     entirely unsubstantiated, lacking factual basis, and
     demonstrative of a fundamental misunderstanding of the operations
     and governance of the entities in question.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 10.5 TO 10.10.23]{.underline}**

115. The contents hereof are admitted only to the extent that they
     accurately reflect the provisions of the Companies Act and the
     Close Corporations Act, including the relevant sections cited by
     the Applicant. The legislative framework and duties imposed under
     the aforesaid statutes are correctly quoted and are not in dispute.

116. However, it is vehemently denied that either myself or the Second
     Respondent have acted in any manner that would constitute a
     contravention, breach, or violation of any of the said statutory
     provisions. At all times, we have fulfilled our obligations as
     directors and/or members diligently, in good faith, and in
     accordance with our fiduciary and statutory duties.

117. We specifically deny that any of our conduct amounts to
     delinquency, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, breach of trust,
     or any form of prejudicial or oppressive behaviour towards the
     Applicant or any other stakeholder. The businesses have been
     managed transparently and responsibly, with the sole objective of
     maintaining financial stability and ensuring continued operations
     in compliance with all applicable laws and governance standards.

118. Any suggestion that our actions have been oppressive, unfairly
     prejudicial, or in disregard of the Applicant's interests is wholly
     not supported by available evidence. The
     Applicant's allegations represent a misinterpretation of the
     Companies Act and the Close Corporations Act and are nothing more
     than an attempt to improperly invoke statutory provisions to
     advance a personal agenda.

119. Accordingly, while the legal references are admitted, the
     allegations of misconduct, delinquency, or breach of fiduciary duty
     are denied in their entirety.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 10.11]{.underline}**

120. The contents hereof are noted only to the extent that the Applicant
     is entitled to seek such relief as he deems appropriate. However,
     it is vehemently denied that there exists any factual or legal
     basis for the declaration of delinquency or probation in respect of
     either myself or the Second Respondent. Neither myself or the
     Second Respondent have at any stage acted contrary to the Companies
     Act or the Close Corporations Act, nor have we engaged in any
     conduct that could remotely justify such relief. Our actions have
     been transparent, in good faith, and always directed toward the
     proper management and financial stability of the entities
     concerned.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 10.12]{.underline}**

121. The contents hereof are denied. There have been no transgressions
     or losses caused by either myself or the Second Respondent. To the
     contrary, all expenditures and financial decisions undertaken were
     legitimate business transactions, properly authorised and recorded.
     The Applicant's request to appoint necessary experts or to embark
     on yet another forensic investigation is unnecessary, redundant,
     and clearly intended to prolong litigation and inflate costs, as
     multiple audits and reviews have already confirmed the accuracy of
     the financial records.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 10.13]{.underline}**

122. The contents of hereof are likewise denied. It is false and
     not supported by evidence to allege that "significant sums of money cannot be
     accounted for." Every transaction can be verified through
     supporting documentation, including invoices, bank statements, and
     accounting entries. Any alleged discrepancies stem not from
     mismanagement or misconduct but from the Applicant's own failure or
     refusal to engage with the company's financial administration and
     documentation, despite having full access to the records.

123. Accordingly, there is no factual basis for the relief sought, and
     the allegations of delinquency, loss, or financial impropriety are
     categorically denied.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 11 TO 11.5]{.underline}**

124. The contents hereof are admitted to the extent that the Applicant,
     myself, and our son are duly appointed directors of RegimA UK Ltd,
     which operates as the United Kingdom head office. It is further
     admitted that the said entity oversees and operates through its
     subsidiary and associated companies, namely RegimA @ Dr H Ltd,
     RegimA Zone Ltd, RegimA Zone Academy Ltd, and RegimA Medic Ltd.

125. It is also noted and admitted, as correctly stated by the Applicant
     himself, that his involvement in the day-to-day operations of these
     entities has been minimal, consistent with his general level of
     participation across the broader RegimA group of companies. The
     operational management, oversight, and strategic direction of these
     entities have primarily been undertaken by myself and the Second
     Respondent in accordance with proper corporate governance
     principles and in the best interests of the businesses.

126. Save as aforesaid, the remaining contents are noted, and nothing
     contained therein alters the fact that the Applicant's
     participation and contribution in both the South African and UK
     operations have been limited in nature and extent.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 11.6 TO 11.9]{.underline}**

127. The contents hereof are denied in their entirety. The Applicant
     provides no supporting proof or documentary evidence to
     substantiate any of the allegations made herein. These averments
     amount to nothing more than blanket statements, speculative in
     nature, and lacking factual foundation.

128. It is specifically denied that the Third to Sixth respondents "do
     not receive payment" from the UK branch. All transactions between
     the South African entities and the UK branch have been properly
     documented, traceable through banking records, and accurately
     reflected in the accounting systems of both jurisdictions. Any
     temporary delays or timing differences in payments arose solely
     from standard business operations and do not, in any way, suggest
     impropriety or mismanagement.

129. It is further denied that any "fraud" occurred or that the former
     UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, engaged in any conduct of that
     nature. Equally, it is denied that our son's appointment as
     managing director of the UK operations arose from any alleged
     wrongdoing. His appointment was based on merit, capability, and his
     proven ability to stabilise and grow the business.

130. There is no factual or evidential basis for the insinuation that
     the UK branch's operations or payment structure constitute a
     "ruse." The UK entities operate transparently and in full
     compliance with both UK and South African corporate and tax
     obligations.

131. Finally, the Applicant's claim that he has "no idea" of the UK
     companies' financial position is his position with all the
     companies. Be that as it may, he has always had access to the
     financial records, management accounts, and operational reports of
     the UK entities. Any alleged lack of understanding or insight is a
     direct result of his own lack of engagement and not due to any
     concealment by the Respondents.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 12 TO 12.1]{.underline}**

132. The contents hereof are denied. The assertion that the relationship
     between the directors and members has "disintegrated and become
     deadlocked" is inaccurate and exaggerated. While there may be
     differences in management style, the companies continue to operate
     effectively and remain financially stable under the stewardship of
     the First and Second Respondents. There has been no paralysis in
     decision-making nor any event warranting liquidation. The
     Applicant's allegations are clearly intended to create a false
     impression of dysfunction in order to justify the relief sought.
     The companies remain viable, solvent, and properly managed, with
     all operational and financial decisions being made transparently
     and in the best interests of the entities.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 12.2]{.underline}**

133. The contents hereof are denied in their entirety. The Applicant
     provides no proof whatsoever of any alleged "misappropriation" or
     irregular outflow of funds from the third to sixth respondents.
     This allegation is a blanket statement, speculative and lacking
     factual or evidential support. All company funds are fully
     accounted for and managed in accordance with accepted accounting
     principles and the Companies Act. There is no evidence of
     irregularities, nor have any "taxation problems" arisen as alleged.
     These broad allegations are without adequate basis, not evidenced, and
     appear to mischaracterize the First and Second Respondents and
     provide inaccurate information to this Honourable Court.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 12.3]{.underline}**

134. The contents hereof are noted only to the extent that the Applicant
     purports to approach this Honourable Court for relief. However, it
     is denied that there exists any legal or factual basis for such
     relief, as there has been no wrongdoing or mismanagement to
     prevent. The First and Second Respondents have acted diligently and
     transparently, ensuring that all financial transactions are
     properly documented, authorised, and beneficial to the
     corporations.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 12.4]{.underline}**

135. The contents hereof are denied. The Applicant's assertion that me
     and the Second Respondent "can serve those corporations in
     capacities other than as director or member" is both illogical and
     impractical. Both myself and the Second Respondent have been
     validly appointed as directors and members in accordance with the
     relevant corporate governance procedures and play integral roles in
     the management and sustainability of the entities. Our continued
     involvement is essential to the operational success of the
     corporations, and there exists no basis, legal or factual, for
     their removal or demotion to any alternative capacity.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 13 TO 13.1]{.underline}**

136. The contents hereof are **denied in their entirety**. There is no
     factual or legal basis for the assertion that the interdicts and
     other relief sought under *Part A* of the notice of motion are
     "essential to the survival" of the Third to Sixth respondents. The
     companies in question remain fully operational, solvent, and
     properly managed in accordance with corporate governance
     principles. There is no "rot" to be "stopped," as alleged -- this
     is a dramatic statement not supported by available evidence, aimed at creating the
     false impression of crisis where none exists.

137. Myself and Second Respondents have continuously ensured that the
     businesses are run transparently, with all financial and
     operational decisions being made in good faith and in the best
     interests of the corporations. The suggestion that the absence of
     the Applicant's interdictory relief would lead to the collapse of
     the entities is not supported by documentation and not supported by evidence.

138. The Applicant's repeated attempts to interfere with management, his
     not supported by available evidence accusations, and his pursuit of unnecessary litigation
     that have caused disruption and uncertainty within the corporate
     group. Accordingly, the relief sought under Part A is not only
     unjustified but constitutes an abuse of process designed to wrest
     control from the lawful directors and members who have, to date,
     ensured the continued stability and success of the entities.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 13.2 TO 13.2.2]{.underline}**

139. The contents hereof are denied. There has been no unlawful conduct
     on the part of either myself or Second Respondent. All actions
     undertaken by the Respondents have been legitimate, transparent,
     and in full compliance with applicable legal and corporate
     governance requirements. The Applicant fails to provide any factual
     or evidentiary basis to substantiate the alleged "unlawful conduct"
     or the supposed "harm" caused to the third to sixth respondents.
     These allegations are speculative, unproven, and amount to nothing
     more than conjecture.

140. It is further denied that any conduct by the First or Second
     Respondent has, or will, lead to the "loss of the entities" as
     alleged. On the contrary, both respondents have worked tirelessly
     to ensure the stability, growth, and sustainability of the
     corporations, which continue to operate effectively and remain
     financially sound.

141. The Applicant has suffered no injury (actual or otherwise) as a
     result of the actions of myself or Second Respondent. The
     Applicant's alleged "apprehension" of future harm is not supported by available evidence and
     unreasonable, particularly in light of the fact that no prior
     unlawful or harmful conduct has been demonstrated. The statements
     contained herein are vague, unsubstantiated, and lacking any
     factual detail or corroborating evidence.

142. Myself and Second Respondents have, at all times, acted prudently
     and in the best interests of the corporations and their
     stakeholders. Accordingly, the claims of harm, injury, or
     apprehended injury are denied in their entirety.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 13.3]{.underline}**

143. The contents hereof are denied. The Applicant has no reasonable or
     well-grounded apprehension of harm, let alone irreparable harm,
     should the relief sought not be granted. The allegations made are
     speculative and unsupported by any credible evidence. The Applicant
     has failed to demonstrate any actual, imminent, or ongoing harm
     caused by the conduct of myself or Second Respondent. On the
     contrary, the companies continue to operate effectively and
     profitably, and no factual basis exists to justify the
     extraordinary interdictory relief sought.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 13.4]{.underline}**

144. The contents hereof are denied. The Applicant is not "without an
     alternative adequate remedy." He has full access to the corporate
     structures, financial information, and statutory mechanisms
     available under both the Companies Act and the Close Corporations
     Act to address any legitimate concerns. Moreover, the Applicant
     could have discussed same with me or the Second Respondent as his
     wife and son.

145. The decision to seek urgent or interim relief is therefore
     unnecessary, premature, and constitutes an abuse of process. The
     Applicant's resort to court proceedings appears to be a strategic
     attempt to exert control over the companies rather than a *bona
     fide* effort to prevent any real harm.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 13.5]{.underline}**

146. The contents hereof are denied. The balance of convenience does not
     favour the granting of any interim or final interdictory relief. To
     the contrary, granting such relief would severely prejudice the
     ongoing operations of the companies, disrupt management, and
     interfere with the Respondents' ability to discharge their duties
     effectively.

147. The Applicant has failed to establish any prima facie right or harm
     that would justify the interference sought. The convenience
     overwhelmingly favours allowing the current management structure to
     continue operating without obstruction.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 13.6 TO 13.7]{.underline}**

148. The contents hereof are denied. The Applicant is not entitled to
     the relief sought under Part A of the notice of motion, whether on
     an interim or final basis. Be that as it may, the order that was
     granted, the Applicant has failed to satisfy any of the legal
     requirements for interdictory relief, namely (which will be
     discussed in further detail below):

     1.  A clear right,

     2.  Irreparable harm, and

     3.  The absence of an alternative remedy.

149. The application is therefore misconceived, lacking merit, and
     should be dismissed with costs.

150. Furthermore, the Applicant's request that any relief not granted
     under Part A be adjudicated under Part B is irregular and
     procedurally improper. The two parts of the application serve
     distinct purposes, and the Applicant cannot rely on the mere
     failure of one to justify the granting of the other. The Applicant
     has not made out a case for any relief under either part of the
     notice of motion, and the claims advanced are speculative,
     unsupported by evidence, and should be dismissed in their entirety.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 14 TO 14.2]{.underline}**

151. The contents of paragraph 14.1 are admitted insofar as they refer
     to the relief sought in Part A of the application. However, I
     specifically deny any allegations or insinuations of financial
     wrongdoing on my part or that of the Second Respondent. Both the
     Second Respondent and I have at all times acted in good faith and
     in accordance with our fiduciary obligations under the Companies
     Act.

152. We welcome and are fully supportive of an independent forensic
     investigation into the financial affairs of the third to sixth
     respondents. We are confident that such an investigation will
     confirm that all funds have been properly administered and that
     there has been no mismanagement or impropriety whatsoever.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 14.3]{.underline}**

153. The contents of this paragraph are denied. At all times, the First
     and Second Respondents have acted diligently, prudently, and in the
     best interests of the third to sixth respondents. We have never
     caused, nor sought to cause, any financial prejudice to the said
     entities. On the contrary, we have ensured their continued
     operation, stability, and compliance with all financial and
     statutory obligations. Any suggestion that we have caused financial
     prejudice is baseless and not supported by available evidence.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 14.4]{.underline}**

154. The contents of this paragraph are noted. The First and Second
     Respondents have no objection to a forensic audit being conducted,
     as we are confident that such an audit will vindicate our conduct
     and confirm that all financial affairs have been managed lawfully
     and transparently. However, we do not wish for Rynette to be
     involved. To this end, we deny that it is either necessary or
     appropriate to exclude us from the financial administration of the
     corporations pending final adjudication. We are responsible for the
     day-to-day running of the businesses, and any such exclusion would
     jeopardise their operations and financial wellbeing.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 14.5]{.underline}**

155. The contents of this paragraph are noted, insofar as it merely
     records the Applicant's prayer for relief. The Respondents reserve
     their rights to fully oppose the relief sought in both Part A and
     Part B of the Notice of Motion, particularly where such relief is
     unnecessary, prejudicial, or not supported by evidence.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 15]{.underline}**

156. The contents of this paragraph are denied. The relief sought by the
     Applicant in terms of the Notice of Motion (seeking to have myself
     and Second Respondents declared delinquent directors, or
     alternatively placed under probation) is a blatant abuse of process
     and entirely without merit. The application is not motivated by any
     genuine concern for corporate governance or the survival of the
     companies, but rather by the Applicant's ongoing attempt to
     maliciously exclude myself and the Second Respondent from the
     businesses that we have managed with integrity for decades.

157. Neither I nor the Second Respondent have ever acted dishonestly,
     recklessly, or in breach of our fiduciary duties. We have, at all
     times, conducted the affairs of the RegimA group lawfully,
     transparently, and in the best interests of the entities, their
     employees, and their continued operation. The Applicant's effort to
     brand us delinquent is therefore not only not supported by available evidence but vexatious,
     calculated solely to damage our reputations and to facilitate his
     hostile takeover of the companies under the guise of
     court-sanctioned legitimacy.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16 TO 16.5]{.underline}**

158. The contents of these paragraphs are denied in their entirety. The
     Applicant's version regarding urgency is patently false,
     not supported by evidence, and crafted purely to justify an unwarranted *ex parte*
     approach to this Honourable Court. As already explained above, the
     R500 000 payment relied upon so heavily by the Applicant was not an
     irregular or unauthorised withdrawal, but a lawful and transparent
     director's loan which was duly approved by both myself and the
     Applicant. The payment was properly accounted for and reflected
     within the internal records of the business. There was therefore no
     factual or legal foundation to allege misappropriation, misconduct,
     or any threat of imminent prejudice that could possibly justify the
     invocation of the Court's urgent jurisdiction.

159. On the Applicant's own version, he allegedly discovered the
     transactions giving rise to his supposed concern in mid-June 2025.
     Had there been any genuine urgency, it would have been incumbent
     upon him to act immediately at that point. Moreover, nothing was
     ever discussed with myself (the Applicant's wife) and the Second
     Respondent (being his son) which would have resolved any issues. It
     is unusual as we have been in business with the Applicant for a
     number of years, and any previous issues were always conveyed and
     discussed.

160. Instead, the Applicant inexplicably failed to take any steps
     whatsoever for an extended period. He then records that the R500
     000 director's loan payment was made on or about 16 July 2025 (a
     date which, if he truly considered it irregular, should have
     prompted immediate recourse to his attorneys or to the Court). Yet
     again, the Applicant did nothing.

161. It was only on 5 August 2025 (almost three weeks later) that the
     Applicant first consulted his attorneys of record, and even then, a
     further two weeks elapsed before any application was launched and
     the interim order was granted. Thus, by the Applicant's own
     admission, nearly two months passed between the time he allegedly
     became aware of the "irregularities" and the time he sought
     judicial intervention. Such unexplained and prolonged inaction is
     fundamentally inconsistent with a case of genuine urgency.

162. The Applicant's conduct demonstrates that the matter was not urgent
     in fact or in law. If he truly believed the companies were at risk,
     he would have acted swiftly and transparently. Instead, he waited
     until it was strategically advantageous to do so, and then used the
     urgent court roll as a means to orchestrate a hostile takeover of
     the companies, to oust myself and the Second Respondent from
     management, and to seize unilateral control of the RegimA
     businesses under the guise of "protecting" them.

163. The so-called urgency was therefore entirely self-created and
     opportunistic. The Applicant's attempt to clothe his calculated
     manoeuvre with a veneer of legitimacy amounts to a gross abuse of
     the urgent procedure, and a manipulation of the *ex parte* process
     in order to secure far-reaching relief without giving us any
     opportunity to be heard. His actions are, in my respectful view,
     *mala fide*, lacking factual merit, and appear to
     provide inaccurate information to this Honourable Court.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16.6]{.underline}**

164. The contents of this paragraph are denied. The Applicant's
     suggestion that time was required to prepare, discuss, and settle
     papers with counsel is irrelevant to the question of urgency. The
     Applicant's own account confirms that he had ample opportunity,
     spanning several weeks, to obtain legal advice and prepare papers,
     which entirely undermines his assertion that the matter was so
     urgent as to justify *ex parte* relief. This further demonstrates
     that any alleged urgency was self-created and contrived for
     strategic purposes, not genuine necessity.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16.7]{.underline}**

165. The contents hereof are denied. It is false and not supported by evidence to
     allege that the Applicant was required to proceed "secretly" to
     avoid "knee-jerk reactions" or further alleged misappropriation.

166. As already stated, there was no misconduct or irregularity to
     conceal. The Applicant's suggestion of secrecy was in truth a
     pretext to exclude myself and the Second Respondent from the
     proceedings entirely, thereby denying us procedural fairness. The
     companies' financial affairs were transparent and lawfully managed,
     and all legitimate transactions were recorded in the ordinary
     course of business. The Applicant's purported need for secrecy
     reveals his true motive -- to obtain a one-sided order and seize
     unilateral control of the businesses.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16.8]{.underline}**

167. The contents of this paragraph are denied. The Applicant's claim
     that his "secret" manner of providing instructions was
     time-consuming is of no legal significance and, if anything,
     demonstrates the absence of genuine urgency. His decision to act
     covertly and delay proper engagement with myself and the Second
     Respondent was a deliberate tactic to manufacture a sense of
     urgency that did not exist. Had the Applicant followed proper
     corporate process and afforded us the opportunity to respond, there
     would have been no need for such surreptitious conduct.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16.9]{.underline}**

168. The contents of this paragraph are denied. There was no without adequate consideration or
     delinquent conduct by either myself or the Second Respondent, nor
     was there any ongoing transgression.

169. All company transactions were lawful, authorised, and supported by
     verifiable documentation. The Applicant's allegations are baseless
     and may be intended to inflame and provide inaccurate information to the Court.

170. Every passing day did not create new urgency. Rather, every passing
     day highlighted the Applicant's ongoing inaction and lack of *bona
     fides*. His delay of nearly two months before bringing this
     application is fatal to his claim of urgency.

171. The Applicant and I have been in business together for over thirty
     years, and the Second Respondent, our son, has been integrally
     involved in the operations of the companies for nearly eighteen
     years. During this extensive period of collaboration, the Applicant
     has never once raised any such allegation of financial misconduct,
     delinquency, or mismanagement. These newfound claims have
     conveniently surfaced only after the Applicant sought to exclude us
     from the management of the RegimA companies.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16.10]{.underline}**

172. The contents of this paragraph are denied. There is no probability,
     or even possibility, of any irreparable harm to the Third to Sixth
     Respondents, as alleged. To the contrary, if there had been any
     genuine concern of such harm, the Applicant would not have
     permitted me to continue performing operational duties on behalf of
     the companies. By way of example, the Applicant expressly allowed
     me to conduct training sessions for staff on 6 and 7 October 2025,
     focusing on product knowledge and brand development -- an exercise
     wholly inconsistent with any suggestion that the businesses were at
     risk of "immediate and irreparable harm."

173. This fact alone exposes the Applicant's allegations as false and
     opportunistic. The reality is that the Applicant's own conduct
     after obtaining the interim order demonstrates that he does not
     genuinely believe the companies to be in danger. Rather, his
     actions confirm that the operations remain reliant upon the
     expertise and leadership of both myself and the Second Respondent.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16.11]{.underline}**

## CRITICAL CORRECTION: JF5 AGREEMENT MANIPULATION

I must bring to this Honourable Court\'s urgent attention a critical
matter regarding the JF5 settlement agreement referenced in paragraph 48
of my affidavit. Upon further investigation, I have discovered that
material changes were made to this agreement after our final review and
immediately before signing, without disclosure to myself and the Second
Respondent.\
\
The agreement initially reviewed by myself and the Second Respondent
stated that assessments would be selected by the \"parties\" themselves.
However, in the final documents presented for signature, every instance
of \"parties\" had been changed to \"parties\' attorneys\" without our
knowledge or consent.\
\
When we inquired whether anything had changed, the attorneys stated
\"No, we just added the details for the attorneys,\" which we
interpreted as administrative contact information. In reality, this
constituted a fundamental change to the agreement terms, transferring
control from the parties to their attorneys.\
\
This constitutes fraud in the inducement, as:\
- Material misrepresentation was made by the attorneys\
- The changes were concealed after our final review\
- We relied on the attorneys\' false assurance that \"nothing changed\"\
- We are now bound to terms we never agreed to\
\
I therefore submit that the JF5 agreement should be declared void or
voidable due to these fraudulent circumstances.

174. The contents of this paragraph are emphatically denied. No funds
     were misappropriated, squandered, or concealed. The R500 000
     payment repeatedly referred to by the Applicant was a properly
     authorised director's loan, as already detailed above. The
     Applicant is fully aware of this fact, as he personally approved
     the transaction. The accusation that monies were hidden or wasted
     is a deliberate falsehood made to create a false impression of
     financial misconduct and to justify his unwarranted and abusive
     resort to urgent, *ex parte* proceedings

**[AD PARAGRAPH 16.12]{.underline}**

175. The contents of this paragraph are denied. The Applicant's
     allegation that the Third to Sixth Respondents (and by implication
     the Applicant himself) would be unable to obtain substantial or any
     redress in due course is entirely not supported by available evidence. There was no urgency
     warranting the invocation of the Court's *ex parte* jurisdiction.

176. On the contrary, the Applicant's true motive in bringing the
     application on this basis was to engineer a hostile takeover of the
     companies and to unilaterally wrest control of their management and
     finances from myself and the Second Respondent. The relief sought
     was calculated to exclude us from the businesses we have diligently
     managed for years and to effectively remove us from our directorial
     and operational roles under the guise of urgency.

177. The Applicant's conduct was therefore not a *bona fide* attempt to
     secure judicial intervention, but a strategic abuse of process
     aimed at consolidating power and control within his sole
     discretion.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 17 TO 17.4]{.underline}**

178. The contents of these paragraphs are denied. The allegation that
     the myself or the Second Respondent would have misappropriated
     funds or reacted in a knee-jerk manner is entirely not supported by available evidence and
     without factual basis.

179. As explained above, the amount of R500 000 referred to by the
     Applicant was not an irregular or unauthorised withdrawal, but a
     legitimate director's loan that was properly discussed and approved
     between myself and the Applicant, in the ordinary course of
     business. The transaction was recorded transparently and in
     accordance with standard accounting practice.

180. There was therefore no justification whatsoever for the Applicant
     to approach this Honourable Court *ex parte*, nor any factual
     foundation for suggesting that I or the Second Respondent would
     have destroyed documents or misappropriated funds. The Applicant's
     reliance on these speculative and not supported by evidence allegations to obtain
     drastic relief without notice constitutes a material non-disclosure
     and a misuse of the urgent court process.

**[AD PARAGRAPH 18]{.underline}**

181. The contents herein are noted in so far as Part A of the
     Applicant's Notice of Motion say that there will be no order to
     costs as same is not opposed.

## EVIDENCE ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION

In addressing this matter comprehensively, I have categorised the
available evidence into three classifications based on evidentiary
strength:\
\
IRREFUTABLE PROOF (Documentary Evidence):\
- Trust creation documentation (December 5, 2013)\
- Asset transfer records (June 18, 2014)\
- Trustee appointment timeline demonstrating fraud in inducement\
- UK company funding evidence (\$77,000+ for Shopify operations)\
- Corporate structure documentation proving distinct ownership\
- Financial statements showing Villa Via\'s 86% profit margins\
\
STRONG SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (Corroborated Facts):\
- Pattern of evidence destruction following confrontation\
- Coordination between Peter and Rynette (proven agency relationship)\
- Systematic transfer pricing manipulation\
- Timeline showing premeditated attack (3-8 day gap between trustee
appointment and ex parte application)\
- My role as fraud detector (confrontation followed by evidence
destruction)\
\
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE (For Investigation):\
- Exact financial extraction amounts requiring forensic analysis\
- Detailed timeline of coordination activities\
- Full extent of damage to business operations\
\
This classification ensures that this Honourable Court has a clear
foundation of irrefutable documentary evidence, supported by strong
corroborating analysis, while distinguishing matters requiring further
investigation.

**[CONCLUSION]{.underline}**

182. In the premises, I respectfully submit that the Applicant's
     application is *mala fide,* vexatious, and constitutes a clear
     abuse of the process of this Honourable Court. It is premised on
     misrepresentations, material non-disclosures, and contrived
     urgency, all advanced with the ulterior motive of effecting a
     hostile takeover of the RegimA group of companies and excluding
     both myself and the Second Respondent from their lawful management.

183. For over three decades, I have dedicated my professional life to
     building, managing, and protecting the RegimA brand, both locally
     and internationally, with transparency, integrity, and diligence.
     The Applicant's recent actions are entirely inconsistent with his
     historical conduct, and his not supported by available evidence allegations of mismanagement
     and delinquency are plainly intended to tarnish my reputation and
     destabilise the businesses that have thrived under the stewardship
     of myself and the Second Respondent.

184. The Second Respondent and I have, at all times, acted in good
     faith, in accordance with our fiduciary duties under the Companies
     Act, and in the best interests of the companies, their employees,
     and their continued success. The Applicant's conduct, by contrast,
     has placed the future of the businesses, the welfare of their
     employees, and the trust of their customers at risk.

185. I therefore pray that this Honourable Court:

     1.  Dismiss the Applicant's application in its entirety;

     2.  Set aside the *ex parte* interim order granted on 19 August
         2025 before the Honourable Justice Kumalo;

     3.  Direct that control and management of the Third to Sixth
         Respondents revert to their proper directors, being myself and
         the Second Respondent; and

     4.  Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the
         attorney-and-client scale, including the costs of two counsel
         where so employed, as a mark of the Court's displeasure at the
         abuse of its urgent and *ex parte* procedures.

186. To the extent necessary, the confirmatory affidavits of the Second
     Respondent, Ian Levitt and Natan Back are attached and marked as
     **[ANNEXURES]{.mark}** accordingly.

**[[THE DELAY IN LAUNCHING THESE PROCEEDINGS]{.underline}]{.mark}**

187. [There has been an unavoidable delay in the launching of these
     proceedings, which delay was neither deliberate nor intended to
     prejudice any party. The delay arose primarily from the fact that,
     following the granting of the interim order, the Second Respondent
     and I initially instructed ENS to represent us. However, their
     approach to the matter proved unsatisfactory, as instead of taking
     decisive steps to challenge the *ex parte* relief, they elected to
     facilitate protracted "round-table" discussions that served only to
     entrench the Applicant's position. As a result, meaningful progress
     was stalled while the businesses continued to suffer operationally
     and reputationally.]{.mark}

188. [At the end of September 2025, the Second Respondent and I
     therefore resolved to terminate ENS's mandate and appoint Ian
     Levitt Attorneys ("ILA") as our new legal representatives. Upon
     their appointment, ILA was required to acquaint themselves fully
     with the matter, which included reviewing voluminous
     correspondence, financial statements, company records, and
     analysing the procedural history of the urgent *ex parte*
     application and its subsequent developments.]{.mark}

189. [It must further be noted that our engagement of ILA coincided with
     the period of the Jewish High Holy Days, namely Rosh Hashanah, Yom
     Kippur, and Sukkot. ILA is a Jewish firm, and both Ian Levitt and
     his candidate attorney, Natan Back, are members of the Jewish
     faith. These festivals are the holiest days in the Jewish calendar,
     during which observant practitioners refrain from work.
     Consequently, the firm's availability was necessarily limited
     during this time, which contributed to further unavoidable delays
     in the preparation of these proceedings. Additionally, our
     instructed counsel, Advocate Doron Block, is likewise of the Jewish
     faith, which compounded the scheduling constraints over this
     religious period.]{.mark}

190. [In addition, given the complex and inter-connected nature of the
     corporate entities involved, spanning multiple companies, close
     corporations, and related financial structures, significant time
     was required to collate the relevant records, obtain certified
     extracts from the CIPC, and reconstruct the factual chronology. ILA
     was further required to hold several consultations with both myself
     and the Second Respondent to obtain a clear, accurate, and
     comprehensive factual matrix upon which to base these proceedings.
     The delay was therefore occasioned by legitimate and practical
     considerations, all directed towards ensuring that the matter is
     properly placed before this Honourable Court with accuracy,
     completeness, and procedural propriety, rather than in undue
     haste.]{.mark}
