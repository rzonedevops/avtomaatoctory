## Common Model Operations

### Initialization
All models support standard initialization patterns:
```python
from models.hypergnn import HyperGNNFramework
model = HyperGNNFramework(case_id="case_001")
```

### Data Integration
Load case data into models:
```python
model.load_case_data(timeline_entries, evidence_items, agents)
```

### Analysis Execution
Run model analysis:
```python
results = model.analyze()
```

### Results Export
Export analysis results:
```python
model.export_results(output_path)
```

## Integration

Models can be integrated for comprehensive analysis:
- HyperGNN + LLM for enhanced relationship extraction
- Discrete Event + System Dynamics for temporal-flow analysis
- All models combined for multi-perspective insights

See [Integrated Analysis Guide](../technical/guides/integrated-analysis.md) for details.

## Performance Considerations

- **HyperGNN**: Memory intensive for large networks (>1000 nodes)
- **LLM**: Requires GPU for optimal performance
- **Discrete Event**: Fast execution, suitable for real-time analysis
- **System Dynamics**: Moderate computational requirements

## Validation

All models include validation mechanisms:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for data flow
- Accuracy metrics for output validation
- Performance benchmarks
