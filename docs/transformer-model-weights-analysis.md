## 📚 Usage Examples and Integration

### Basic Model Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from case_llm import CaseLLMTransformer, PerspectiveConfig

# Load model and tokenizer
model = CaseLLMTransformer.from_pretrained("case-llm-v1.0")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("case-llm-v1.0")

# Process case text
case_text = """
On March 15, 2025, the defendant made contact with the victim 
regarding a business transaction. Evidence suggests the defendant 
misrepresented material facts about the investment opportunity.
"""

# Tokenize and encode
inputs = tokenizer(case_text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

# Generate analysis with all perspectives
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs, output_attentions=True, output_perspectives=True)
    
# Extract perspective-specific insights
perspectives = outputs.perspective_outputs
victim_insight = perspectives['victim']
legal_insight = perspectives['legal']
investigator_insight = perspectives['investigator']

print(f"Victim perspective confidence: {victim_insight.confidence:.3f}")
print(f"Legal admissibility score: {legal_insight.admissibility_score:.3f}")
print(f"Investigation priority: {investigator_insight.priority_score:.3f}")
```

### Integration with HyperGNN

```python
from hypergnn_core import HyperGNNFramework
from case_llm import CaseLLMTransformer
from integration import CrossModelAnalyzer

# Initialize both models
hypergnn = HyperGNNFramework(case_id="case_2025_001")
case_llm = CaseLLMTransformer.from_pretrained("case-llm-v1.0")

# Create integration analyzer
analyzer = CrossModelAnalyzer(hypergnn, case_llm)

# Run cross-model analysis
case_data = load_case_data("case_2025_001")
results = analyzer.analyze_case(case_data)

# Extract integrated insights
integration_score = results.integration_metrics.overall_score
cross_model_insights = results.cross_model_insights
confidence_calibrated = results.calibrated_confidence

print(f"Integration success: {integration_score:.3f}")
print(f"Cross-model insights: {len(cross_model_insights)}")
print(f"Calibrated confidence: {confidence_calibrated:.3f}")
```

### Custom Perspective Configuration

```python
# Define custom perspective for forensic analysis
forensic_config = PerspectiveConfig(
    name="forensic_analyst",
    focus_tokens=["forensic", "trace", "DNA", "fingerprint", "physical"],
    weight_multiplier=1.3,
    attention_bias={"technical_evidence": 2.0, "physical_evidence": 1.8},
    specialization_level=0.95
)

# Add custom perspective to model
model.add_perspective_head(forensic_config)

# Fine-tune on forensic cases
forensic_data = load_forensic_training_data()
model.fine_tune_perspective("forensic_analyst", forensic_data, epochs=3)
```

## 🎯 Best Practices and Guidelines

### Model Deployment

#### Production Checklist
- [ ] Verify all perspective heads are properly calibrated
- [ ] Test cross-model integration with representative cases
- [ ] Validate attention pattern consistency across similar cases
- [ ] Confirm confidence calibration on held-out test set
- [ ] Benchmark inference time and memory usage
- [ ] Set up monitoring for attention pattern drift
- [ ] Configure fallback mechanisms for low-confidence predictions

#### Performance Optimization
```python
# Optimize for inference speed
model.half()  # Use 16-bit precision
model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode
torch.jit.script(model)  # JIT compilation

# Memory optimization
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = False

# Batch processing for efficiency
def batch_process_cases(cases, batch_size=8):
    for i in range(0, len(cases), batch_size):
        batch = cases[i:i+batch_size]
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model.batch_forward(batch)
            yield outputs
```

#### Monitoring and Maintenance
```python
class ModelMonitor:
    def __init__(self, model, threshold_config):
        self.model = model
        self.thresholds = threshold_config
        self.attention_history = []
        
    def check_attention_drift(self, current_attention):
        # Monitor for significant changes in attention patterns
        if len(self.attention_history) > 100:
            historical_mean = torch.mean(torch.stack(self.attention_history[-100:]), dim=0)
            drift_score = torch.norm(current_attention - historical_mean)
            
            if drift_score > self.thresholds['attention_drift']:
                self.trigger_alert("Attention pattern drift detected")
                
    def validate_cross_model_consistency(self, hypergnn_output, llm_output):
        consistency_score = calculate_consistency(hypergnn_output, llm_output)
        if consistency_score < self.thresholds['consistency']:
            self.trigger_alert("Cross-model consistency below threshold")
```
