In addition te the aforesaid, I annex hereto the '? related expenses

(annexure “PF9” hereto) which my son has approved and/or paid over

the 2024 to 2025 financial year.

Other than a few, such as Sage (being accounting software), the ma-

jority are unexplained, and we have almost no invoices for these items

which creates, inter alia, major tax problems.

The ‘expenses’ from March 20265, to June 2025, relating to computer

related costs solely, are attached hereto marked “PF10".

The 2024 tax year ‘expenses’, for this category alone, amount to

R6,738,007.47.

The 2025 tax year, thus far, for this category only, amounts to

R2,116,159.47,

These amounts exclude the ‘birthday gift, aforesaid, and are almost

entirely unexplainable.

Many of the ‘expenses’ are also seemingly international.
