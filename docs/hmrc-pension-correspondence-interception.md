**Date Discovered**: October 2025  
**Affected Party**: Jacqui Faucitt (UK pension recipient)

## Executive Summary

## Timeline of Escalation

### Phase 1: Original Impersonation (Pre-Reset)

- **Controller**: Rynette Farrar (OCR verified)
- **Discovery**: June 2025 OCR evidence revealed unauthorized control
- **Action Taken**: Address was reset

### Phase 2: Impersonation Infrastructure Expansion  
- **May 29, 2025**: Rynette's son registers regimaskin.co.za domain
- **June 2025**: Domain used for customer redirection scheme
- **Post-Reset**: Pete@regimaskin.co.za created as replacement impersonation address

### Phase 3: Government Correspondence Interception
- **Target**: HMRC (UK) pension correspondence for Jacqui Faucitt
- **Method**: Official correspondence redirected to pete@regimaskin.co.za
- **Impact**: UK government pension communications intercepted by unauthorized parties

## Legal Analysis
