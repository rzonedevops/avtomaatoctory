- Locked out of all accounts
- Cannot function financially

### NOT Jacqui Faucitt
- Needs cooperation for R10M collection
- Dragged into baseless litigation
- Not even involved in finances

### Definitely Benefits:

#### Rynette Farrar
✓ Maintains unauthorized control  
✓ No oversight while parties fight  
✓ Time to move money (R12M already gone)  
✓ Perfect distraction from her crimes  

#### Possibly Danie Bantjies
✓ Divided creditors are weaker  
✓ Chaos helps avoid payment  
✓ Can exploit their conflict  

## The Evidence Trail

### Documentary Proof
1. **System access logs**: Show Rynette's sole control
2. **Corporate records**: She's not a director/shareholder
3. **Timeline evidence**: Coordinated takeover in June
4. **Financial records**: R12M transfer Sept 11
5. **Domain registration**: Son owns competing site

### What Can Be Proven
- Only Rynette could move the R12 million
- Peter has no access to steal anything
- Jacqui has no financial involvement
- Daniel's loan was legitimate and necessary
- The conflict serves third-party interests

## Legal Implications

### Criminal Acts by Rynette
1. **Fraud**: Exceeding authority as bookkeeper
2. **Theft**: Controlling funds without right
3. **Conspiracy**: Son's involvement in domain scheme
4. **Breach of Trust**: Denying employer access

### Civil Issues
1. **Breach of Fiduciary Duty**: By Rynette
2. **Conversion**: Unauthorized control of assets
3. **Interference**: With business operations
4. **Damages**: From customer redirection

## Required Immediate Actions

### 1. Criminal Investigation
- Rynette's unauthorized control
- R12M transfer investigation
- Domain fraud scheme
- Conspiracy charges

### 2. Asset Protection
- Freeze accounts immediately
- Remove Rynette's access
- Forensic audit all transactions
- Recover stolen funds

### 3. Strategic Realignment
- Peter & Jacqui must recognize common interests
- Unite to collect R10M from Bantjies
- Stop fighting each other
- Focus on real perpetrators

### 4. Corporate Governance
- Restore legitimate control
- Implement proper oversight
- Document all authority
- Prevent future breaches

## The Bottom Line

### What Really Happened
1. A bookkeeper seized control she had no right to
2. She orchestrated/exploited conflict between co-creditors
3. R12 million was moved while they were distracted
4. Their R10 million collection is at risk
5. Every day of conflict benefits the perpetrators

### The Truth About Each Party
- **Peter**: Victim locked out of his own accounts
- **Jacqui**: No financial involvement, no wrongdoing
- **Daniel**: Legitimate director protecting his company
- **Rynette**: Unauthorized controller who moved R12M
- **Bantjies**: Owes both parties R10M+

### The Path Forward
1. Recognize the manipulation
2. Unite against common threats
3. Recover stolen assets
4. Collect the R10M debt
5. Pursue criminal charges

## Conclusion

This case is not about Peter vs Jacqui. It's about:
- A bookkeeper who stole control
- Co-creditors who should be allies
- R12 million moved by unauthorized party
- R10 million at risk if unity isn't achieved
- Criminal acts disguised by manufactured conflict

The evidence is clear: The real perpetrator maintains control while the victims fight each other.
