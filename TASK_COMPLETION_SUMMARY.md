3. **Payment Sabotage Scale**: 15 cards, 300+ bills, 78-day example quantified
4. **IP Destruction Scale**: 100M+ files documented
5. **Business Viability Proof**: 12 months sales data proves operations were viable until sabotage

**Fraud Scheme Evolution Analysis**:
- Phase 1: Asset Stripping (February 2025) - R5.2M inventory
- Phase 2: Infrastructure Seizure (April-May 2025) - Server preparation
- Phase 3: Revenue Diversion (May 22, 2025) - R34.9M+ at risk ← **NEW EVIDENCE FOCUS**
