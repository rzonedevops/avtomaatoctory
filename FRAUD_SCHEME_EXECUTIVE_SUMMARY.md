# CRITICAL FRAUD DISCOVERY: Systematic Profit Extraction Scheme

## üö® EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Scheme Type**: Systematic profit extraction and debt shifting fraud
**Financial Impact**: ZAR 12M+ transfer from Dan to non-Dan entities (February 2025)
**Sophistication**: High - Multi-entity coordinated fraud using ownership intersections
**Legal Severity**: Critical - Multiple corporate, tax, and fraud law violations

## üìä FRAUD SCHEME FLOW

### Step 1: Asset Stripping (SLG)
- **ZAR 5.2M stock disappearance** from Strategic Logistics
- **Forced selling at losses** to RegimA Skin Treatments
- **Debt injection** via intercompany loan forcing insolvency

### Step 2: Profit Generation (RST)
- **Healthy profits** from below-cost inventory acquisition
- **Minimal expenses** (ZAR 16K IT) despite having all employees
- **Artificial profit creation** in non-Dan entity

### Step 3: Expense Dumping (RWD)
- **All company expenses dumped** in RegimA Worldwide Distribution
- **No employees** but carries all operational costs
- **Systematic loss generation** in Dan entity

### Step 4: Profit Extraction (VVA)
- **86% profit margin rent** extraction by Villa Via Arcadia
- **ZAR 4M+ enrichment** for Pete
- **Kept outside 'group'** to hide extraction mechanism

## üé≠ CONCEALMENT MECHANISMS

### False Group Framing
- **SLG-RST-RWD** falsely framed as 'Group'
- **VVA deliberately excluded** to hide final extraction
- **Makes rent extraction appear external** rather than internal transfer

### Expense Attribution Fraud
- **IT expenses blamed on 'Danny's personal indulgences'**
- **Reality**: RWD has no employees but carries all expenses
- **Evidence**: RST only ZAR 16K IT despite all employees

### Victim Blaming Narrative
- **Pete complains** 'Group made loss due to Dan's expenses'
- **Reality**: Pete extracted ZAR 4M+ through VVA
- **Hypocrisy**: Complains about losses while personally enriched
