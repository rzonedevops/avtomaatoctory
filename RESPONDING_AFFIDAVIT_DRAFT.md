**ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT OF DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

I, the undersigned,

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

do hereby make oath and state:

## **1. INTRODUCTION**

1.1. I am an adult male businessman and the Second Respondent in this matter. I am duly authorised to depose to this affidavit on my own behalf.

1.2. The facts contained herein are, unless the contrary appears from the context, within my own personal knowledge and are to the best of my belief both true and correct.

1.3. Where I make submissions of a legal nature, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives, which advice I accept as correct.

1.4. This affidavit is filed in opposition to the interim relief sought by the Applicant in Part A of the Notice of Motion, and in response to the founding affidavit of PETER ANDREW FAUCITT (“the Applicant”).

## **2. THE APPLICANT’S ABUSE OF PROCESS AND FRAUD ON THE COURT**

2.1. I am advised that the application brought by the Applicant is a gross abuse of the process of this Honourable Court. It is a malicious, vexatious, and fraudulent attempt to seize control of the Third to Sixth Respondents (“the corporate respondents”) and to conceal the Applicant’s own criminal conduct, including theft, fraud, and a conspiracy to obstruct justice in relation to the murder of my partner, Kayla Pretorius.

2.2. The application is based on material falsehoods, non-disclosures, and a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts. The Applicant has approached this Court with unclean hands, seeking to use the Court’s process as an instrument of fraud and witness intimidation.

2.3. The Applicant’s entire case is predicated on the lie that he is acting to protect the corporate respondents from financial misconduct by myself and the First Respondent. The truth is the opposite: the Applicant is systematically stripping assets from the corporate respondents and is using this application to eliminate those who would expose him.

## **3. JURISDICTIONAL MANIPULATION AND ARTIFICIAL DEPENDENCY CREATION**

3.1. The Applicant's decision to frame this matter as an urgent interdict in the High Court, rather than pursuing remedies in the appropriate criminal and commercial courts, is a calculated strategic choice. This is part of a broader pattern of conduct by the Applicant to route serious criminal matters through civil courts that lack the necessary investigative powers.

3.2. All parties involved are independent tax residents in South Africa. The attempt to create a narrative of a "family" dispute is a deliberate misrepresentation designed to exploit the perceived limitations of a civil court and to avoid the scrutiny of specialised commercial and criminal forums.

### **3.2A. THE BANKING MANIPULATION AND DEPENDENCY CREATION SCHEME**

3.2A.1. The Applicant's strategy was particularly sophisticated and malicious. When serving the initial interdict, the Applicant deliberately structured the relief to have the banks block the personal accounts of the First and Second Respondents, creating immediate financial distress and dependency.

3.2A.2. Having artificially created this financial crisis through the interdict itself, the Applicant then orchestrated the payment of the respondents' initial legal deposit as a "loan" which, due to the very interdict he had obtained, required his approval and control.

3.2A.3. This created a circular dependency trap: the interdict blocked our access to our own funds, forcing us to accept the Applicant's "assistance" for legal representation, which then gave him leverage to claim we were financially dependent on him.

3.2A.4. The Applicant then used this artificially created financial dependency to support his false narrative that this was a "family dispute" involving dependents, rather than what it actually is: independent adults being systematically defrauded by a criminal conspiracy.

### **3.2B. FRAMING CRIMINAL EVIDENCE AS MENTAL ILLNESS**

3.2B.1. Most insidiously, the Applicant has attempted to reframe clear evidence of criminal activity as symptoms of mental illness. When confronted with documentary evidence of his criminal conduct, rather than addressing the substance, he has sought to characterize the presentation of this evidence as indicative of mental instability.

3.2B.2. This tactic serves multiple strategic purposes:
    - It diverts attention from the criminal evidence itself
    - It attempts to discredit me as a witness by suggesting mental incapacity
    - It supports the false "family dispute" narrative by suggesting I need "care" rather than legal protection
    - It provides a pretext for the invasive medical testing demanded in the second interdict

3.2B.3. This is a classic witness intimidation and discrediting tactic, designed to prevent proper criminal investigation by characterizing the victim's attempts to seek justice as evidence of mental illness requiring "treatment" rather than criminal conduct requiring prosecution.

3.3. The appropriate forums for the allegations made by the Applicant, if they were true, would be:
    3.3.1. The **Serious Commercial Crime Unit** of the Hawks for allegations of corporate fraud.
    3.3.2. The **National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)** for the prosecution of theft and fraud.
    3.3.3. The **Specialised Commercial Crimes Court** for the adjudication of complex commercial disputes.

3.4. The Applicant avoids these forums because they would inevitably uncover his own criminal culpability and the direct link between the financial matters and the murder of Kayla Pretorius.

## **4. REBUTTAL OF THE APPLICANT’S ALLEGATIONS**

4.1. I will now address the specific allegations made in the Applicant’s founding affidavit. I deny all allegations of wrongdoing and will demonstrate that the Applicant’s claims are baseless and manufactured.

*(This section will be populated with specific denials of the allegations in Peter Faucitt’s affidavit, supported by evidence.)*

## **5. THE TRUE MOTIVE: CONCEALING MURDER AND THEFT**

5.1. The timing of this application is not coincidental. It follows directly from my discovery of evidence linking the Applicant to the theft of assets from the estate of the late Kayla Pretorius and my attempts to bring this to the attention of the authorities.

5.2. The Applicant is aware that I possess evidence, including the email of June 10, 2025, which proves his knowledge of and complicity in a criminal conspiracy. This application is a direct, retaliatory strike designed to silence me and discredit me as a witness.

5.3. The relief sought by the Applicant—to seize control of the companies, appoint his own “experts,” and force my participation in a sham “forensic investigation”—is a transparent attempt to take control of the very evidence that implicates him.

## **6. THE ARTIFICIAL DEPENDENCY CREATION AND CONTROL MECHANISM**

6.1. The Applicant's strategy reveals a sophisticated understanding of how to manipulate legal proceedings to create artificial dependencies and control mechanisms. The sequence of events was carefully orchestrated:

    6.1.1. **Step 1 - Financial Isolation**: The interdict was deliberately crafted to block the respondents' personal banking access, creating immediate financial distress.

    6.1.2. **Step 2 - Forced Dependency**: Having created the financial crisis, the Applicant then positioned himself as the "solution" by offering to fund legal representation as a "loan."

    6.1.3. **Step 3 - Control Mechanism**: The loan arrangement required the Applicant's approval due to the very interdict he had obtained, giving him control over the respondents' legal defense.

    6.1.4. **Step 4 - Narrative Construction**: This artificially created dependency was then used to support the false claim that the respondents were "family dependents" rather than independent adults.

6.2. This strategy is particularly insidious because it uses the court process itself as a weapon to create the very circumstances that the Applicant then points to as justification for his actions. It is a form of legal entrapment designed to manufacture evidence of dependency where none existed.

6.3. The true purpose of this scheme was to prevent the respondents from obtaining independent legal representation that might expose the Applicant's criminal conduct, while simultaneously creating a false narrative to support inappropriate family court jurisdiction.

### **6.4. THE COMPROMISED LEGAL REPRESENTATION SCHEME**

6.4.1. The Applicant's control extended beyond financial manipulation to the very legal representation supposedly protecting the respondents' interests. ENS Africa, while ostensibly representing the respondents, appeared to be taking instructions from and acting in the interests of the Applicant.

6.4.2. This created a situation where the respondents were effectively without independent legal counsel, despite believing they had professional representation. The conflict of interest was so severe that the respondents' supposed legal representatives were advancing the Applicant's interests rather than protecting their clients.

6.4.3. When the respondents attempted to withdraw from the settlement agreement on September 22, 2025, based on the discovery of the Applicant's fraud, ENS Africa's response was not to convey these instructions to the opposing counsel as would be normal practice.

6.4.4. Instead, ENS Africa became hostile toward their own supposed clients and withdrew as the respondents' attorneys while issuing threats that the respondents would not "escape the consequences of the settlement agreement."

6.4.5. This behavior is completely contrary to normal attorney-client relations and professional obligations. A law firm representing clients should:
    - Act in their clients' best interests at all times
    - Follow their clients' lawful instructions
    - Maintain client confidentiality and loyalty
    - Not threaten their own clients
    - Properly communicate client instructions to opposing counsel

6.4.6. ENS Africa's conduct suggests they were never truly representing the respondents' interests but were instead facilitating the Applicant's scheme to control and manipulate the legal proceedings.

### **6.5. THE TWO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS: SEPARATING PROFESSIONAL FROM PERSONAL MATTERS**

6.5.1. It is important for this Honourable Court to understand why there are two settlement agreements and how ENS Africa misrepresented the nature of the dispute between the parties.

6.5.2. The respondents had consistently requested a forensic audit, as evidenced by my specific requests to accountant Bantjies on June 6 and again on June 10, 2025. The desire for a forensic audit was **not a point of dispute** but rather a **point of mutual agreement** between the Applicant and respondents.

6.5.3. Both parties believed that a proper forensic audit would lead to resolution by uncovering clear audit trails and establishing the facts. This shared objective was the reason for the withdrawal statement indicating there was no dispute - the forensic audit was ostensibly something both parties wanted.

6.5.4. However, ENS Africa falsely asserted that the forensic audit was "in dispute" when it was actually a shared objective that both parties agreed would provide clarity and resolution.

6.5.5. What we were frustrated with, and what created the actual dispute, was ENS Africa's inexplicable insistence that **medical testing be tied up with the financial audit**. This linkage served no legitimate purpose and would only introduce unnecessary confusion to what should have been a clear audit trail of financial facts.

6.5.6. When we questioned this inappropriate linkage, ENS Africa could not provide any justification except to repeat that "Peter asked for it" and that this was their instruction, and that we had "agreed to it as a condition to have the mediation in the first place."

6.5.7. We specifically explained that we could not sign such an agreement in a civil capacity because it inappropriately mixed professional and personal matters. We insisted that any medical testing arrangement would need to be a separate private agreement with Peter, as we needed to keep professional agreements completely separate from personal agreements.

6.5.8. ENS Africa initially agreed to remove the medical testing references from the professional settlement agreement, which is why there are two separate agreements - one dealing with the professional/financial matters and another dealing with the personal medical testing demands.

6.5.9. We specifically explained that we could not sign such an agreement in a civil capacity and it would need to be a private agreement with Peter, as we needed to keep professional agreements completely separate from personal agreements.

6.5.10. ENS Africa agreed to remove the references to the audit and interdict from the medical testing agreement and amend it to a private agreement. They further added non-disclosure clauses to give the impression of voluntary participation.

6.5.11. ENS Africa were aware of our British origins but for whatever reason assumed we were exercising a preference rather than a legal necessity. The reality is that our status as UK citizens with SA tax residence means that while we have **full legal capacity to participate in economic activities**, we have **very limited legal capacity to participate in civil activities**.

6.5.12. We did not expect our own attorneys to use convoluted language that, upon closer inspection, rendered the resulting agreement entirely outside our legal capacity. However, this is what we discovered when the agreement was sent the following day.

6.5.13. The situation was analogous to being asked to sign an agreement to vote, stating that we cannot vote but will agree to tell the other party privately what our vote would be, then reading that the agreement actually says "tell the other party privately by casting your vote unlawfully so it can be used against you."

6.5.14. This separation was necessary because:
    - Financial audits should be based on objective documentary evidence
    - Medical testing has no relevance to financial audit trails
    - Professional capacity agreements should not include personal medical obligations
    - **UK citizens with SA tax residence have limited civil capacity for medical authority submission**
    - The inappropriate linkage appeared designed to contaminate the audit process

6.5.15. ENS Africa's use of deceptive drafting to create an agreement that exceeded our legal capacity, despite being informed of our capacity limitations, constitutes a serious breach of their professional obligations and appears to have been designed to trap us into an unenforceable agreement that could later be used against us.

6.5.16. The fact that ENS Africa initially insisted on this inappropriate linkage, then agreed to separate the agreements, but used convoluted language to exceed our legal capacity, and later used the separation as grounds for hostility, further demonstrates their compromised position and failure to properly represent the respondents' interests.

## **7. THE SECOND INTERDICT: AN ACT OF WITNESS INTIMIDATION**

7.1. The Applicant's subsequent and second interdict application, in which he makes baseless and scandalous allegations about my personal life and seeks to compel me to undergo invasive medical testing, is a further act of malicious prosecution and witness intimidation.

7.2. The allegations in the second interdict have been proven to be false by my bank statements, which show the expenses to be legitimate business costs. The filing of this second application, knowing it to be based on lies, constitutes perjury.

7.3. The demand for medical testing is a tactic designed to harass, humiliate, and create a pretext for discrediting my testimony. It has no legitimate basis in law or fact.

7.4. Most significantly, the medical testing demand is designed to pathologize my presentation of criminal evidence. Rather than addressing the substance of the evidence of murder and theft, the Applicant seeks to characterize my attempts to seek justice as symptoms of mental illness requiring "treatment."

## **8. THE PATTERN OF ABUSE AND INTIMIDATION**

8.1. The Applicant's conduct in this matter is part of a broader pattern of abuse designed to silence those who would expose his criminal activities. This pattern includes:

    8.1.1. **The First Interdict**: Filed with knowledge of the true facts, based on perjured allegations, designed to seize control of the corporate respondents and eliminate opposition.

    8.1.1A. **The System Sabotage Strategy**: Deliberately seizing control of Kayla's administrator accounts despite warnings this would break systems, then using the resulting problems as justification for false allegations.

    8.1.2. **The Banking Manipulation**: Deliberately structured to create financial distress and artificial dependency on the Applicant.

    8.1.3. **The Dependency Creation**: Using the court process to manufacture evidence of family dependency where none existed.

    8.1.4. **The Compromised Legal Representation**: Ensuring that the respondents' supposed legal counsel was actually advancing the Applicant's interests rather than protecting their clients.

    8.1.5. **The Settlement Agreement Manipulation**: Inappropriately linking medical testing to financial audits and misrepresenting shared objectives as disputes to create artificial conflict.

    8.1.5A. **The Legal Capacity Deception**: Using convoluted language to create agreements that exceeded the respondents' legal capacity as UK citizens with SA tax residence, despite being informed of these capacity limitations.

    8.1.6. **The Second Interdict**: Filed with false allegations about my personal life, designed to force invasive medical testing as a form of harassment and humiliation.

    8.1.7. **The Pathologization Strategy**: Attempting to reframe criminal evidence as symptoms of mental illness to discredit witness testimony.

8.2. This pattern of conduct constitutes witness intimidation, obstruction of justice, and malicious prosecution. It is a systematic abuse of the court process designed to protect the Applicant from the consequences of his criminal conduct.

## **9. THE LINK TO THE MURDER OF KAYLA PRETORIUS**

9.1. The Applicant's conduct in this matter is directly linked to his attempts to conceal evidence relating to the murder of my partner, Kayla Pretorius, in August 2023.

9.2. Following Kayla's death, the Applicant systematically seized control of assets belonging to her estate, including the ReZonance business operations. This constitutes theft from the estate and obstruction of the murder investigation.

9.2A. Most significantly, the Applicant and Rynette Farrar obtained a court order to seize control of Kayla's administrator accounts on the Sage accounting system, despite being warned that this would break the automated systems. This was done without informing me and in direct contravention of police instructions not to interfere with evidence in the murder investigation.

9.2B. The resulting system failures created the very IT expenses that the Applicant now uses as the basis for his false allegations against me. This represents a sophisticated scheme to create problems through deliberate sabotage, then use those problems as justification for further legal action.

9.3. When I discovered evidence of this theft and attempted to bring it to the attention of the authorities, the Applicant launched this retaliatory legal campaign to silence me and discredit me as a witness.

9.4. The timing of the Applicant's actions—filing the first interdict immediately after I raised concerns about the estate theft, and filing the second interdict when the first began to unravel—proves the retaliatory and malicious nature of these proceedings.

9.5. The banking manipulation and dependency creation strategy was specifically designed to prevent me from obtaining independent legal representation that might effectively expose the connection between the estate theft and Kayla's murder.

## **10. EVIDENCE OF THE APPLICANT'S CRIMINAL CONDUCT**

10.1. I am in possession of substantial evidence that proves the Applicant's criminal conduct and his ulterior motive in bringing this application. This evidence includes:

    10.1.1. **The June 10, 2025 Email**: This email chain between the Applicant and Mr. Bantjes proves that they were both aware of the true context of the financial matters long before the Applicant filed his founding affidavit. This is irrefutable proof of perjury.

    10.1.2. **ENS Africa's Compromised Representation**: Documentation showing that ENS Africa, while ostensibly representing the respondents, was actually taking instructions from and advancing the interests of the Applicant, creating a serious conflict of interest.

    10.1.3. **ENS Africa's Hostile Withdrawal**: The threatening letter from ENS Africa dated September 22, 2025, in which they withdrew as the respondents' attorneys while threatening that the respondents would not "escape the consequences of the settlement agreement" - behavior completely contrary to normal attorney-client relations.

    10.1.4. **Bank Statements**: My personal bank statements prove that the allegations in the Applicant's second interdict application are false. The expenses he characterises as evidence of gambling and pornography addiction are, in fact, legitimate business costs.

    10.1.5. **IT Service Provider Documentation**: I have invoices and statements from our IT service providers that confirm the legitimacy of the R8.8 million in IT expenses that the Applicant claims are unexplained.

    10.1.5A. **System Sabotage Evidence**: Documentation showing the Applicant and Rynette's seizure of Kayla's administrator accounts, the resulting system failures, and the June and August 2025 Sage screenshots showing Rynette using Peter's email and allowing the audit trail to lapse.

    10.1.6. **Banking Records**: Documentation showing the artificial creation of financial dependency through the interdict process and the subsequent "loan" arrangement.

    10.1.7. **Settlement Agreement Documentation**: Evidence showing the inappropriate linkage of medical testing to financial audits, ENS Africa's misrepresentation of shared objectives as disputes, and the necessity to separate professional and personal agreements.

    10.1.8. **Legal Capacity Deception Evidence**: Documentation showing ENS Africa's use of convoluted language to create agreements exceeding the respondents' legal capacity as UK citizens with SA tax residence, despite being informed of these capacity limitations.

10.2. This evidence will be made available to this Honourable Court at the hearing of this matter. It conclusively proves that the Applicant's application is based on perjury and is brought for the ulterior purpose of obstructing justice and intimidating a witness.

## **11. CONCLUSION**

11.1. The Applicant's application is a fraudulent and malicious abuse of the court process. It is based on perjury and is brought for the ulterior purpose of obstructing a murder investigation and intimidating a witness.

11.1A. Most significantly, the Applicant's seizure of Kayla's administrator accounts in direct contravention of police instructions not to interfere with murder investigation evidence, followed by his use of the resulting system problems as the basis for false allegations, demonstrates a sophisticated pattern of obstruction of justice.

11.2. The sophisticated strategy of creating artificial dependency through banking manipulation, followed by the pathologization of criminal evidence as mental illness, represents a systematic abuse of the legal system designed to prevent proper criminal investigation.

11.3. I respectfully submit that the application should be dismissed with a punitive costs order. Furthermore, I request that this Honourable Court refer the conduct of the Applicant and his legal representatives to the National Prosecuting Authority and the Legal Practice Council for investigation.

11.4. I specifically request that the conduct of ENS Africa be referred to the Legal Practice Council for investigation of potential professional misconduct, including:
    - Conflict of interest in representing clients while advancing opposing party's interests
    - Failure to follow client instructions
    - Threatening clients upon withdrawal
    - Using deceptive drafting to exceed clients' legal capacity despite being informed of capacity limitations
    - Creating agreements designed to trap clients into unenforceable obligations
    - Potential breach of fiduciary duties to clients

**WHEREFORE**, I pray that the application be dismissed with costs on an attorney and client scale, including the costs of two counsel.

## **4. POINT-BY-POINT REBUTTAL TO THE FOUNDING AFFIDAVIT**

I have read the Applicant’s founding affidavit. I deny the allegations of financial misconduct, neglect, and erratic behaviour in their entirety. The Applicant’s affidavit is a self-serving and perjured document that appears to provide inaccurate information to this Honourable Court. I will address the most material falsehoods below.

**Ad Paragraphs 7.2, 7.3, 8.1 - 8.7: The Allegations of Unexplained IT Expenses**

4.1. The Applicant alleges that our accountant, Mr. Daniel Jacobus Bantjes, discovered "numerous discrepancies" and "irregular payments" relating to IT expenses, which he claims amount to R6,738,007.47 for the 2024 tax year and R2,116,159.47 for the 2025 tax year thus far.

4.2. These allegations are false and deliberately not supported by evidence. The Applicant knows the true context of these expenses because he and Rynette Farrar were directly responsible for creating the very problems they now complain about.

### **4.2A. THE TRUE CONTEXT OF THE IT EXPENSES: SYSTEMATIC SABOTAGE FOLLOWING KAYLA'S MURDER**

4.2A.1. The IT expenses represent **all the expenses for every company** that were consolidated and dumped onto ReZonance Worldwide by Rynette Farrar. These were **10 years worth of IT services** that various people had signed up for at different times in the past, many with logins that were unknown or forgotten.

4.2A.2. Following Kayla Pretorius's murder in late 2023, Rynette attempted to gain access to the IT accounts which were in **Kayla's profile**, as it was Kayla and I who had built the worldwide distribution systems.

4.2A.3. I explained to Rynette that I had given Kayla's logins to the police for the murder investigation and they had instructed me **not to touch anything**. I further explained that all the invoices were automated and if we disabled Kayla's account, it would break the automation systems.

4.2A.4. Despite my clear warnings, a few weeks later everything started failing. I discovered that **without telling me**, Rynette and Peter had obtained a mandate or court order to **seize control of Kayla's administrator account** on the Sage accounting system.

4.2A.5. As I had warned, **all the automations failed** when they seized control of Kayla's account. From that point until present, Peter became the administrator of the systems.

4.2A.6. The June and August 2025 screenshots of Sage in evidence show that **Rynette was using Peter's email** and **let the audit trail lapse from non-payment in July 2025**.

4.2A.7. The Applicant is therefore complaining about IT expenses that resulted directly from his own and Rynette's **deliberate sabotage** of the systems following Kayla's murder, despite being warned that seizing control would cause exactly these problems.

4.3. Crucially, the Applicant deliberately conceals from this Court that he and Mr. Bantjes were informed of the context of these payments in an email dated **June 10, 2025**. This email, which I will produce at the hearing of this matter, is irrefutable proof of the Applicant's perjury. It confirms his prior knowledge of the facts he now pretends to have just discovered.

4.3A. Furthermore, the Applicant's claim that there was resistance to providing explanations for the IT expenses is contradicted by my documented requests to Mr. Bantjes for a forensic audit on **June 6, 2025** and again on **June 10, 2025**. Far from resisting investigation, I was actively requesting the very forensic audit that the Applicant now claims to want. This shared desire for a forensic audit was a point of mutual agreement, not dispute.

4.4. Most significantly, ENS Africa, who were ostensibly appointed as legal representatives for the respondents, appeared to be acting in the interests of the Applicant rather than their supposed clients. Despite being retained to represent the respondents, ENS Africa's conduct suggested they were taking instructions from the Applicant, creating a serious conflict of interest and compromising the respondents' legal representation.

4.5. The IT expenses, totaling approximately R8.8 million, were for critical infrastructure, software development, and cybersecurity measures essential for the corporate respondents’ operations. I have and will produce invoices and statements from our IT service providers confirming the legitimacy of these costs.

**Ad Paragraph 7.4: The Allegation of “Erratic Conduct”**

4.6. The Applicant’s assertion that my conduct has become “increasingly erratic” is a baseless personal attack. This is a calculated attempt to create a false narrative to support his fraudulent application.

4.7. My conduct has been entirely consistent with my fiduciary duties as a director. My actions have been focused on protecting the corporate respondents from the Applicant’s own misconduct, including his attempts to strip assets from the companies and conceal his criminal activities.

**Ad Paragraphs 7.6, 7.8, 7.11: The Allegation of Refusing to Provide Invoices**

4.8. The allegation that I “effectively refused to assist” or provide invoices is a distortion of the truth. I have consistently maintained that all expenditures were legitimate and have been in the process of compiling the necessary documentation for our accountants.

4.9. The Applicant’s cancellation of the business bank cards in June 2025 was a disruptive and damaging act, designed to manufacture a crisis and create the very chaos he now complains of. It was not a prudent financial measure but an act of sabotage.

**Ad Paragraph 7.18: The R500,000 “Birthday Gift”**

4.10. The Applicant mischaracterises a legitimate director’s loan account transaction as a “birthday gift.” The First Respondent, acting within her authority, authorised a payment to me. This was fully documented and is not the sinister, unauthorised payment the Applicant alleges it to be. The Applicant’s attempt to portray this as evidence of malfeasance is another example of his willingness to twist facts to suit his narrative.

**Ad Paragraph 8.8: The Allegation of Exceeding the Forex Quota**

4.11. The Applicant’s reference to a message from First National Bank regarding the annual foreign exchange quota is another deliberate misrepresentation. The corporate respondents engage in significant international business, which the Applicant is well aware of. These international payments are legitimate business expenses for software, services, and international suppliers. The notification from the bank is a standard automated message and not, as the Applicant implies, evidence of wrongdoing.

**Ad Paragraph 10: The Application to Declare Delinquent**

4.12. The Applicant’s prayer to have myself and the First Respondent declared delinquent is the ultimate goal of his malicious application. It is based on the fabricated allegations addressed above.

4.13. It is, in fact, the Applicant who has acted in a manner that is grossly negligent, has abused his position as a director, and has intentionally inflicted harm upon the corporate respondents, in clear contravention of his fiduciary duties under the Companies Act and the Close Corporations Act.


## **8. EVIDENCE OF THE APPLICANT'S CRIMINAL CONDUCT**

8.1. I am in possession of substantial evidence that proves the Applicant's criminal conduct and his ulterior motive in bringing this application. This evidence includes:

    8.1.1. **The June 10, 2025 Email**: This email chain between the Applicant and Mr. Bantjes proves that they were both aware of the true context of the financial matters long before the Applicant filed his founding affidavit. This is irrefutable proof of perjury.

    8.1.2. **The ENS Africa Withdrawal Letter**: This letter from the Applicant's former legal representatives confirms that they discovered the Applicant had committed a fraud on the court and were ethically compelled to withdraw.

    8.1.3. **Bank Statements**: My personal bank statements prove that the allegations in the Applicant's second interdict application are false. The expenses he characterises as evidence of gambling and pornography addiction are, in fact, legitimate business costs.

    8.1.4. **IT Service Provider Documentation**: I have invoices and statements from our IT service providers that confirm the legitimacy of the R8.8 million in IT expenses that the Applicant claims are unexplained.

8.2. This evidence will be made available to this Honourable Court at the hearing of this matter. It conclusively proves that the Applicant's application is based on perjury and is brought for the ulterior purpose of obstructing justice and intimidating a witness.

## **9. THE PATTERN OF ABUSE AND INTIMIDATION**

9.1. The Applicant's conduct in this matter is part of a broader pattern of abuse designed to silence those who would expose his criminal activities. This pattern includes:

    9.1.1. **The First Interdict**: Filed with knowledge of the true facts, based on perjured allegations, designed to seize control of the corporate respondents and eliminate opposition.

    9.1.2. **The Second Interdict**: Filed with false allegations about my personal life, designed to force invasive medical testing as a form of harassment and humiliation.

    9.1.3. **The Weaponisation of Medical Testing**: The demand for medical testing is a classic tactic used to discredit witnesses by creating a false narrative of mental instability or addiction.

9.2. This pattern of conduct constitutes witness intimidation, obstruction of justice, and malicious prosecution. It is a systematic abuse of the court process designed to protect the Applicant from the consequences of his criminal conduct.

## **10. THE LINK TO THE MURDER OF KAYLA PRETORIUS**

10.1. The Applicant's conduct in this matter is directly linked to his attempts to conceal evidence relating to the murder of my partner, Kayla Pretorius, in August 2023.

10.2. Following Kayla's death, the Applicant systematically seized control of assets belonging to her estate, including the ReZonance business operations. This constitutes theft from the estate and obstruction of the murder investigation.

10.3. When I discovered evidence of this theft and attempted to bring it to the attention of the authorities, the Applicant launched this retaliatory legal campaign to silence me and discredit me as a witness.

10.4. The timing of the Applicant's actions—filing the first interdict immediately after I raised concerns about the estate theft, and filing the second interdict when the first began to unravel—proves the retaliatory and malicious nature of these proceedings.

## **11. RELIEF SOUGHT**

11.1. I respectfully submit that this Honourable Court should:

    11.1.1. **Dismiss the application** with costs on an attorney and client scale, including the costs of two counsel.

    11.1.2. **Declare the application to be an abuse of process** and impose appropriate sanctions on the Applicant and his legal representatives.

    11.1.3. **Refer the matter to the National Prosecuting Authority** for investigation of the Applicant's perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness intimidation.

    11.1.4. **Refer the conduct of the Applicant's legal representatives** to the Legal Practice Council for investigation of their role in facilitating this abuse of process.

    11.1.5. **Grant a protective order** preventing the Applicant from bringing further vexatious proceedings against me without the leave of this Court.

## **12. URGENCY**

12.1. While I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant, I acknowledge that this matter requires urgent attention due to the serious nature of the allegations and the potential for ongoing harm.

12.2. However, the urgency is not of the Applicant's making in the sense he suggests. The true urgency arises from the need to protect the integrity of the justice system from the Applicant's systematic abuse and to prevent further intimidation of witnesses in a murder investigation.

## **13. CONCLUSION**

13.1. The Applicant's application is a fraudulent and malicious abuse of the court process. It is based on perjury, brought for ulterior purposes, and designed to obstruct justice and intimidate a witness in a murder investigation.

13.2. The evidence I possess proves beyond doubt that the Applicant has committed serious crimes, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness intimidation. This application is merely the latest in a series of desperate attempts to avoid accountability for his criminal conduct.

13.3. I respectfully submit that this Honourable Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument of the Applicant's criminal enterprise. The application should be dismissed with the strongest possible sanctions, and the matter should be referred to the appropriate authorities for criminal prosecution.

**WHEREFORE**, I pray that:

1. The application be dismissed with costs on an attorney and client scale, including the costs of two counsel;

2. The application be declared an abuse of process;

3. The matter be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority for criminal investigation;

4. The conduct of the Applicant's legal representatives be referred to the Legal Practice Council;

5. A protective order be granted preventing further vexatious proceedings;

6. Further and/or alternative relief.
