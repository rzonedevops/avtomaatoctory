## Evidence of Coordinated Takeover

## Critical Facts for Legal Action

### 1. Rynette's Lack of Authority

## Evidence Summary

### What This Proves
1. **Rynette has no legal right** to sole control of accounts
2. **The control was seized** not granted
3. **Legitimate parties are victims** of financial hijacking
4. **The takeover was coordinated** (cards, domains, access)

### Who Did What
- **Rynette**: Seized unauthorized control as mere bookkeeper
- **Rynette's son**: Provided infrastructure for customer theft
- **Peter**: Victim locked out of own accounts
- **Daniel**: Forced to use personal funds due to lockout

### The Money Question
- **Who can steal money?** Only Rynette (sole access)
- **Who can't steal money?** Everyone else (no access)
- **Who is stealing customers?** Redirected to son's domain

## Recommendations for Immediate Action

1. **Criminal charges**: Fraud, theft, breach of trust
2. **Civil action**: Breach of fiduciary duty, conversion
3. **Corporate action**: Remove unauthorized access immediately
4. **Banking intervention**: Alert banks to unauthorized control
5. **Customer notification**: Inform about fraudulent redirection

## Conclusion

A bookkeeper with no ownership or directorship has:
- Seized complete control of all financial systems
- Locked out all legitimate parties including owners
- Coordinated with family members to redirect business
- Maintained sole access to enable any theft or misallocation

This is not a case of authorized access being misused - this is unauthorized seizure of control by someone with no legal right to such access.
