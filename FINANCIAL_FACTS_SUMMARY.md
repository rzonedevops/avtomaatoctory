# Financial Facts Summary - Case 2025_137857

## The R500,000 Director's Loan - Actual Facts

### What Actually Happened
1. **June 7, 2025**: Company cards cancelled secretly
2. **June 7 - July 16**: Daniel pays company creditors from personal account (6 weeks)
3. **July 16, 2025**: Daniel takes R500,000 director's loan from his own company
4. **Purpose**: Reimburse personal payments and maintain business operations

### Who is Daniel Faucitt?
- **Company founder and owner**
- **Has legal right to take director's loans**
- **Was protecting the business from defaulting on obligations**

### Who is Jacqui Faucitt?
- **Does NOT handle finances**
- **Did NOT give anyone R500,000**
- **Has NO involvement in financial transactions**
- **Has done NOTHING wrong financially**

## Correcting the False Narrative

### The Lie Being Told:
"Jacqui gave Daniel R500,000 as an unauthorized birthday gift"

### The Documented Truth:
- Daniel took a director's loan from his own company
- This is legal and properly documented
- It was necessary due to secret card cancellations
- Jacqui had nothing to do with it

## Who Can Actually Access Money?

### Rynette Farrar
- **Status**: ONLY person with account access
- **Capabilities**: Can transfer funds, access accounts, control money
- **Evidence**: System documentation shows exclusive access

### Peter Faucitt
- **Status**: NO account access
- **Capabilities**: Cannot steal money he can't access
- **Evidence**: Email address controlled by Rynette

### Jacqui Faucitt
- **Status**: NOT involved in finances
- **Capabilities**: Cannot access or transfer funds
- **Evidence**: No documentation of any financial role

### Kayla's Money
- **Who could have taken it?** Only Rynette (she has exclusive access)
- **Who couldn't have taken it?** Peter (no access) or Jacqui (not in finance)

## The Bottom Line

1. **Jacqui Faucitt** - Innocent of any financial wrongdoing
2. **Daniel's R500k** - Legal director's loan, not a gift from anyone
3. **Peter Faucitt** - Technically incapable of stealing (no access)
4. **Rynette Farrar** - Only person who could misallocate funds

## Supporting Evidence
- System access logs showing Rynette's exclusive control
- Timeline documenting card cancellations and director's loan
- Financial records showing director's loan (not gift)
- No evidence of Jacqui's involvement in any finances
