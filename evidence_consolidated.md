# Trust Deed - Clauses 15 to 19

The trustees shall be entitled to accumulate the whole or any part of such income for any period they shall think fit and either retain the same uninvested (without responsibility for any loss) or invest the same in any of the securities or investments hereinbefore authorised.

## 15. Termination, vesting and distribution of trust assets

The trust can also terminate at a time as determined by the trustees in their sole and absolute discretion and the trust assets will vest in the beneficiaries on that date.

## 16. Payment of minor's share

Any moneys payable to or on behalf of or for the benefit of any beneficiary, while such beneficiary is still a minor, shall not be paid or handed over to the guardian's or other statutory fund. While any beneficiary is a minor, the trustees may pay and hand over to his parent or guardian or to any person in whose legal custody that beneficiary is, all moneys due to such beneficiary for his maintenance in terms of this deed and an acquittance from that person shall be a valid and legal discharge to the trustees in respect of the moneys in question.

## 17. Exclusion of community of property

All benefits which any beneficiary may receive in terms of this trust deed shall at all times and for all purposes be excluded from any community of property or any community of profit and loss or any accrual in terms of the Matrimonial Property Act 88 of 1984.

## 18. Suspension of beneficiary's contingent rights in the event of cession, attachment or insolvency

### 18.1
The trust assets and/or income to which any beneficiary may become entitled under the provisions of this trust deed shall not, prior to distribution or payment thereof by the trustees to such beneficiary, be capable of being ceded, assigned, mortgaged or pledged by such beneficiary or be attachable by any creditor of such beneficiary or vest in his trustee on insolvency.

### 18.2
In the event of distribution of the trust assets or payment of income as aforesaid being made to any beneficiary:
#### 18.2.1
He purports to or attempts to cede, assign, mortgage or pledge such trust assets and/or income of any part thereof; or
#### 18.2.2
he commits or suffers any act, default or process of law whereby such trust assets and/or income or any part thereof would, but for the provisions of this paragraph, become vested in, attachable by or payable to any other person or persons; or
#### 18.2.3
he commits an act of insolvency or is declared insolvent or assigns his estate for the benefit of his creditors; or
#### 18.2.4
he becomes incapable of managing his own affairs,

then, in each case, the contingent right of that beneficiary to any share of the trust assets and/or income shall be suspended and shall remain vested in the trustees subject to the provisions of sub-clause 18.4.1 hereof.

### 18.3
The trustees shall in any of the events mentioned in sub-clause 18.2 hereof, and subject to the further conditions set out in sub-clause 18.4 hereof, apply the trust assets and/or income for the maintenance of that beneficiary or his spouse or for the maintenance of the lawful children of that beneficiary.

### 18.4.1
On the rehabilitation of that beneficiary or discharge of that beneficiary from insolvency or the ceasing of the possibility of attachment or the discharge of the occurrence giving rise to the suspension in terms of sub-clause 18.2 hereof, the trust shall terminate forthwith and the trustee shall in their sole discretion pay the capital and any undistributed income to that beneficiary or his spouse and/or his children.

### 18.4.2
Where that beneficiary dies and none of the events set out in sub-clause 19.4.1 hereof has taken place, then the right of the beneficiary which has been so suspended, shall pass to his testate or intestate heirs as the case may be.

## 19. Payment to beneficiary may be in cash or kind

Payments to any beneficiary under this trust deed may be made by the trustees either by delivery of assets of the trust or in cash as they in their sole and absolute discretion shall determine. The trustees shall have the right to make payment to any particular beneficiary or beneficiaries by delivery or transfer of assets or to pay cash in lieu of assets to any other beneficiary or beneficiaries. The trustees shall determine the valuation of such assets

# Trust Deed - Clauses 6.30 to 6.34 and Section 7

trust fund by the trustees; and generally to decide any question which may arise as to how much constitutes capital and how much constitutes income by apportioning in such manner as they may consider fit;

## 6.30 To pay in specie or cash

In making payment at any time to any beneficiary of any portion of the trust fund in terms of this deed, the trustees shall be entitled to make any such payment either in cash or in specie or partly in cash and partly in specie. The trustees' valuation of any asset distributed by them in specie in terms hereof shall be final and binding on all interested parties. For the purpose of this clause the word "specie" shall be deemed to include any capital asset at that time held as portion of the trust fund which is in a form other than cash money.

## 6.31 Power to apply income for the maintenance, education or benefit of a beneficiary

The trustees may, in their sole and absolute discretion, use and apply the whole or any portion of the income of the trust assets for the maintenance, education (including university education in the Republic of South Africa or elsewhere), support, advancement and general welfare of any such beneficiary, setting him or her up in a business or a profession or fitting him or her for a career. Any income which may be so applied or used by the trustees in terms hereof may at their discretion be paid either to such beneficiary or to any other person or to any school or university on his or her behalf. If the income of the trust assets is, in the opinion of the trustees, insufficient for the aforementioned purposes or any of them, the trustees shall be entitled to apply or use so much of the capital of the trust as they may consider reasonable. Any capital so applied or used shall be brought (or not be brought) into account as part of the capital, share or interest to which any such beneficiary may become entitled.)

## 6.32 Power to apply capital for the advancement or benefit of a beneficiary

The trustees may during the trust period, in such manner as they in their absolute discretion deem fit, pay or apply any capital of the trust for the advancement or benefit of any person who may become entitled to such capital or of any share thereof, notwithstanding that such person will only become entitled thereto contingently on his or her attaining any specified age or subject to a gift over on his or her death under any specified age or that the interest of such person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which such person belongs and such payment or application may be made notwithstanding the occurrence of any other event provided that:

1. If any such person is or becomes absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to any share in the trust assets the capital so paid or applied shall be brought into account as part of such share;
2. in the event that the person to or on whose behalf such payment or application shall have been made does not attain a vested interest in the amount so paid or applied, neither he nor his estate shall be liable to make or to be called upon to make any restitution to the trustees or to the trust assets;
3. during the lifetime of the founder the trustees shall not pay or apply any capital to or for the benefit of any such person without the prior consent in writing of the founder.

## 6.33 Holding of shares on behalf of the trust

In the event of a company or a unit trust scheme prohibiting, in terms of its articles or regulations, the transfer of shares or units into the names of the trustees as such, the shares or units shall be registered in their personal names or in the names of their representatives and shall be held as nominees on behalf of the trust.

## 6.34 Creation of further trusts

### 6.34.1
Should the trustees consider making any payment out of income or any distribution out of trust capital they are entitled, after consultation with the beneficiaries concerned and subject to any other terms of this trust deed, to create such further trust or trusts in respect thereof for the exclusive benefit of the said beneficiary and/or any spouse or sporting spouse and/or children of such beneficiary and to pay such income or contribute such capital to the said further trust or trusts.

### 6.34.2
The duration of such trust or trusts shall be determined by the trustees.
