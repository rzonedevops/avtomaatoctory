# Final Evidence Summary - The Real Story

## The Unauthorized Financial Takeover

### Who is Rynette Farrar?
- **Official Position**: Bookkeeper at RegimA Skin Treatments
- **NOT**: A director of any company
- **NOT**: A shareholder of any company
- **NOT**: Authorized for sole control

### What Control Does She Have?
- **SOLE access** to ALL company bank accounts
- **SOLE access** to ALL business accounts
- **Complete control** of Pete@regima.com (Peter's email)
- **System administrator** on all financial platforms

### Is This Legal?
**NO** - A bookkeeper cannot legally have sole control of all company finances without director/shareholder status

## The June 2025 Coordinated Takeover

### The Setup (May 29, 2025)
- Rynette's son registers regimaskin.co.za
- Not a company domain
- Preparation for customer redirection

### The Execution (June 7, 2025)
1. All company cards cancelled
2. All legitimate parties locked out
3. Only Rynette maintains access
4. Customers redirected to son's domain

### The Result
- Peter Faucitt: Cannot access his own money
- Other directors: Cannot access company funds
- Daniel: Forced to pay from personal account
- Rynette: Total unsupervised control

## The September 11 Transfer

### What Happened
- **Amount**: R12,330,131.18 transferred
- **Date**: September 11, 2025
- **Who had access**: ONLY Rynette Farrar
- **Who was locked out**: Everyone else

### The Only Logical Conclusion
Only the person with sole access could make the transfer

## Correcting False Narratives

### "Peter stole Kayla's money"
- **IMPOSSIBLE**: Peter has no account access
- **FACT**: He can't even see his own accounts
- **REALITY**: Locked out by bookkeeper

### "Jacqui gave Daniel R500k"
- **FALSE**: Jacqui doesn't handle finances
- **TRUTH**: Director's loan from company Daniel owns
- **REASON**: To pay creditors after card cancellation

### "Unauthorized transactions"
- **BY WHOM?**: The only unauthorized person is Rynette
- **REALITY**: Bookkeeper seized control without authority

## The Legal Implications

### Criminal Acts by Rynette
1. **Fraud**: Acting beyond bookkeeper authority
2. **Theft/Conversion**: Controlling funds without right
3. **Conspiracy**: Son's involvement in domain scheme
4. **Breach of Trust**: Denying employer access

### Corporate Governance Breach
- Non-director controlling all finances
- Non-shareholder making all decisions
- Employee locking out employers
- Bookkeeper exceeding all authority

## Who Can Do What - The Reality

### Rynette Farrar (Bookkeeper)
- **Should be able to**: Basic bookkeeping under supervision
- **Actually can do**: EVERYTHING (illegally)

### Peter Faucitt (Director/Owner)
- **Should be able to**: Access and control company funds
- **Actually can do**: NOTHING (locked out)

### Jacqui Faucitt
- **Should be able to**: Nothing (not in finance)
- **Actually can do**: Nothing (as it should be)

### Daniel Faucitt (Company Owner)
- **Should be able to**: Take director's loans, manage company
- **Actually can do**: Only through personal account

## The Evidence Trail

### Documentary Proof
1. Rynette's employment: Bookkeeper only
2. Corporate records: She's not a director
3. Share registry: She's not a shareholder
4. System access: Shows sole control
5. Timeline: Shows coordinated takeover

### The Smoking Gun
- May 29: Son registers competing domain
- June 7: Cards cancelled, parties locked out
- June: Customers redirected
- Sept 11: R12 million moved
- Only person with access: Rynette

## Conclusions

1. **Rynette Farrar** has illegally seized control of all finances
2. **No one else** can access any accounts
3. **Peter is a victim**, not a perpetrator
4. **Jacqui** has no involvement in finances
5. **Daniel's loan** was legitimate and necessary
6. **Customer theft** via son's domain is documented
7. **R12 million** could only be moved by Rynette

## Required Actions
