## **THE TRUE CONTEXT OF THE IT EXPENSES: SYSTEMATIC SABOTAGE AND OBSTRUCTION OF MURDER INVESTIGATION**

### **Background: The ReZonance Worldwide Distribution System**

4.2A.1. To understand the true context of the IT expenses that form the basis of the Applicant's false allegations, this Honourable Court must understand the nature of the ReZonance Worldwide distribution system and how it was systematically sabotaged following Kayla Pretorius's murder.

4.2A.2. ReZonance Worldwide was built by myself and Kayla Pretorius as a comprehensive global distribution platform. The system integrated multiple companies, subsidiaries, and service providers through automated processes that had been developed and refined over approximately **10 years**.

4.2A.3. The IT infrastructure was complex and interconnected, with **Kayla Pretorius serving as the primary administrator** for most of the critical systems, including the Sage accounting platform that managed the automated invoicing and payment processes.

### **The Consolidated IT Expenses: A Decade of Services**

4.2A.4. The IT expenses that the Applicant now characterizes as "irregular" and "unexplained" represent **all the expenses for every company** that were consolidated and allocated to ReZonance Worldwide by Rynette Farrar.

4.2A.5. These expenses encompassed **10 years worth of IT services** that various individuals had signed up for at different times throughout the development of the business. Many of these services had:
    - Login credentials that were unknown or forgotten
    - Automated billing that continued regardless of active use
    - Legacy integrations that were essential to system stability
    - Multiple redundant services that provided backup functionality

4.2A.6. The complexity of this IT ecosystem meant that any disruption to the administrative structure would have cascading effects throughout the entire system, potentially causing widespread failures and additional costs.

### **Kayla's Murder and the Police Investigation**

4.2A.7. Following Kayla Pretorius's murder in **August 2023**, the police investigation required preservation of all digital evidence, including the IT systems and accounts that Kayla had administered.

4.2A.8. I was specifically instructed by the investigating officers to **provide Kayla's login credentials** to the police for the murder investigation. Critically, I was also instructed **not to touch anything** that might constitute evidence in the investigation.

4.2A.9. This created a delicate situation where the IT systems needed to continue operating to maintain business continuity, but any changes to Kayla's administrative access could potentially compromise the murder investigation.

### **Rynette's Attempt to Gain Access**

4.2A.10. In late 2023, shortly after Kayla's murder, **Rynette Farrar attempted to gain access** to the IT accounts that were registered under Kayla's profile and administrative control.

4.2A.11. When Rynette approached me about accessing these systems, I explained the situation clearly:
    - Kayla's login credentials had been provided to the police for the murder investigation
    - The police had instructed me not to interfere with any potential evidence
    - All the invoicing and payment processes were automated through Kayla's accounts
    - Disabling or changing Kayla's account access would break the automation systems
    - Any disruption could cause widespread system failures and additional costs

4.2A.12. I specifically warned Rynette that **if we disabled Kayla's account, it would break the automation** that managed the complex web of IT services and billing processes.

### **The Unauthorized Seizure of Control**

4.2A.13. Despite my clear warnings about the consequences and the police instructions not to interfere with evidence, **a few weeks later everything started failing**.

4.2A.14. Upon investigation, I discovered that **without informing me**, Rynette Farrar and the Applicant had obtained **a mandate or court order to seize control of Kayla's administrator account** on the Sage accounting system.

4.2A.15. This seizure was conducted:
    - Without my knowledge or consent
    - In direct contravention of police instructions not to interfere with murder investigation evidence
    - Despite specific warnings that it would cause system failures
    - Without any technical consultation about the consequences

### **The Predictable System Failures**

4.2A.16. Exactly as I had warned, **all the automations failed** when they seized control of Kayla's administrator account.

4.2A.17. The system failures included:
    - Breakdown of automated billing processes
    - Loss of integration between different service providers
    - Failure of payment automation systems
    - Disruption of service continuity across multiple platforms
    - Creation of duplicate charges and billing errors
    - Loss of historical configuration data

4.2A.18. From the point of seizure until the present, **Peter Faucitt became the administrator** of the systems, taking control of the very infrastructure that Kayla and I had built over a decade.

### **The Financial Strangulation Strategy**

4.2A.19. The system sabotage was compounded by a deliberate **financial strangulation strategy** designed to cripple ReZonance's ability to operate effectively.

4.2A.20. **Outstanding payments from RegimA Skin Treatments to ReZonance** totaling **ZAR 1,035,000+** dating from **February 2023** have been withheld for nearly **3 years**. To put this in perspective, comparing this amount to ReZonance's Profit & Loss statements, this represents approximately **1 year of total turnover** (not profit) for ReZonance.

4.2A.21. Due to the **protracted withholding of these funds**, ReZonance could not purchase new services necessary to continue invoicing RegimA, creating a deliberate cash flow crisis that served the Applicant's purposes of:
    - Preventing ReZonance from operating independently
    - Creating artificial financial distress to justify intervention
    - Forcing dependency on the Applicant's "assistance"
    - Providing cover for the systematic asset stripping

### **The Bookkeeping Sabotage**

4.2A.22. Following the seizure of Kayla's administrator accounts and in the context of the ongoing murder investigation, when Peter and Rynette claimed they were "taking care of the accounts," I accepted their representations as true, believing they would fulfill their stated obligations.

4.2A.23. However, I discovered **12 hours before the annual accounts deadline on March 30, 2025** that **not a single transaction had been processed by the bookkeepers** despite months of assurances that the accounting was being handled.

4.2A.24. This deliberate negligence was particularly egregious because:
    - Rynette's sister Linda had been specifically hired ostensibly for the purpose of assisting with the bookkeeping
    - The Applicant and Rynette had taken control of the accounting systems
    - They had provided repeated assurances that the accounts were being managed
    - The deadline crisis was entirely manufactured through their deliberate inaction

### **Evidence of Ongoing Mismanagement**

4.2A.25. The **June and August 2025 screenshots of the Sage system**, which form part of the evidence in this matter, clearly show that:
    - **Rynette Farrar was using Peter Faucitt's email address** to access the systems
    - The **audit trail was allowed to lapse from non-payment in July 2025**
    - Critical system maintenance was neglected under Peter's administration
    - The very accountability mechanisms that should track expenses were deliberately disabled

4.2A.26. This evidence proves that the Applicant and Rynette not only caused the initial system failures but continued to mismanage the systems in a way that would make proper accounting and audit trails impossible.

4.2A.27. The pattern reveals a systematic strategy of **administrative sabotage**:
    - Seize control of critical systems
    - Provide false assurances of proper management
    - Deliberately neglect essential functions
    - Create crisis situations at critical deadlines
    - Use the resulting chaos to justify further intervention

### **The Manufactured Crisis Strategy**

4.2A.28. The Applicant's conduct reveals a sophisticated strategy of **manufactured crisis** that operates on multiple levels:

**Financial Level:**
    - **Step 1**: Withhold ZAR 1,035,000+ in payments for nearly 3 years
    - **Step 2**: Create cash flow crisis preventing normal business operations
    - **Step 3**: Force dependency on Applicant's "assistance"
    - **Step 4**: Use financial distress to justify intervention and control

**Administrative Level:**
    - **Step 1**: Seize control of critical systems despite warnings of consequences
    - **Step 2**: Provide false assurances of proper management
    - **Step 3**: Deliberately neglect essential bookkeeping functions
    - **Step 4**: Create deadline crises through deliberate inaction

**Legal Level:**
    - **Step 1**: Allow the predictable system failures to occur
    - **Step 2**: Use the resulting problems as justification for false allegations
    - **Step 3**: Claim the expenses caused by their sabotage are evidence of misconduct
    - **Step 4**: Launch legal proceedings based on manufactured evidence

4.2A.29. This multi-layered strategy serves multiple criminal purposes:
    - Obstructs the murder investigation by interfering with digital evidence
    - Creates artificial justification for legal action against witnesses
    - Provides cover for systematic asset stripping of Kayla's estate
    - Generates false evidence to support perjured allegations
    - Forces financial dependency to enable control and manipulation
    - Creates administrative chaos to prevent proper forensic accounting

### **Obstruction of Justice and Evidence Tampering**

4.2A.23. The Applicant's seizure of Kayla's administrator accounts constitutes **obstruction of justice** because:
    - It was done in direct contravention of police instructions
    - It interfered with evidence in an active murder investigation
    - It was conducted without informing the murder victim's partner who was cooperating with police
    - It resulted in the destruction of audit trails and system integrity

4.2A.24. The subsequent mismanagement of the systems, including allowing audit trails to lapse, may be intended to **destroy evidence** that might be relevant to both the murder investigation and the systematic theft of estate assets.

### **The Applicant's Knowledge and Perjury**

4.2A.25. The Applicant's allegations about "unexplained" IT expenses constitute **perjury** because:
    - He knows the expenses resulted from his own sabotage of the systems
    - He was warned that seizing control would cause exactly these problems
    - He has been the administrator of the systems since the seizure
    - He allowed the audit trails to lapse, making proper accounting impossible

4.2A.26. The Applicant cannot claim ignorance of the true cause of the IT expenses when he and Rynette were the direct cause of the system failures that generated those expenses.

### **Connection to Estate Theft**

4.2A.27. The seizure of Kayla's administrator accounts was not merely about system control but was part of the **systematic theft of estate assets**:
    - It gave the Applicant control over the business systems Kayla had built
    - It enabled the redirection of business income away from estate beneficiaries
    - It provided cover for asset stripping by creating accounting chaos
    - It prevented proper forensic accounting of estate assets

4.2A.28. The timing of the seizure, immediately following Kayla's murder, and the subsequent use of the resulting problems to attack Kayla's partner, reveals the calculated nature of this scheme.

### **Conclusion: Manufactured Evidence**

4.2A.29. The IT expenses that form the basis of the Applicant's allegations are not evidence of misconduct by the respondents but are **manufactured evidence** created by the Applicant's own deliberate sabotage of systems he was warned not to interfere with.

4.2A.30. This represents a sophisticated form of **evidence manufacturing** where the Applicant:
    - Creates problems through deliberate interference
    - Uses the resulting chaos to justify false allegations
    - Weaponizes the consequences of his own misconduct against his victims
    - Obstructs justice while appearing to seek accountability

4.2A.31. The true purpose of this strategy is to **obstruct the murder investigation**, **facilitate estate theft**, and **intimidate witnesses** who might expose the Applicant's criminal conduct.
