## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0

1. **Install new dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

2. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Initialize Alembic (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

4. **Update database synchronization scripts:**
   - Replace usage of `supabase_sync.py` with `supabase_sync_enhanced.py`
   - Replace usage of `neon_sync.py` with `neon_sync_enhanced.py`

5. **Run tests to verify compatibility:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/integration/test_enhanced_database_sync.py -v
   ```

### Breaking Changes

- **Database synchronization scripts** have been enhanced with new APIs
- **Type hints** may require updates to existing code that extends the framework
- **Error handling** patterns have been standardized across modules

### Deprecation Notices

- `supabase_sync.py` is deprecated in favor of `supabase_sync_enhanced.py`
- `neon_sync.py` is deprecated in favor of `neon_sync_enhanced.py`
- Manual SQL execution patterns should be replaced with Alembic migrations
