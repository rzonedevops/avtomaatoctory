# Repository Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan for making incremental improvements to the `rzonedevops/analysis` repository.

## 1. Code Quality and Standards

### Issues Identified

- **Unused Imports and Variables**: Static analysis with `pyflakes` revealed unused imports in `frameworks/hypergnn_core.py` and `tools/timeline_validator.py`, and an unused variable in `frameworks/hypergnn_core.py`.
- **Missing Type Hints**: Several functions and methods lack type hints, reducing code clarity and making it harder to catch type-related errors.
- **Limited Docstrings**: Some functions have missing or incomplete docstrings, making it difficult to understand their purpose and usage.

### Proposed Solutions

- **Fix Static Analysis Issues**: Remove the identified unused imports and variables. (Completed)
- **Add Comprehensive Type Hinting**: Add type hints to all function and method signatures to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Enhance Docstrings**: Write comprehensive docstrings for all functions and methods, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

## 2. Database Management

### Issues Identified

- **Manual Schema Management**: The `supabase_sync.py` script uses a custom RPC function to execute raw SQL, which is not a robust or scalable solution for managing database schema changes.
- **Lack of Migration History**: There is no version control for the database schema, making it difficult to track changes and roll back to previous versions.

### Proposed Solutions

- **Implement Alembic for Database Migrations**: Replace the manual SQL execution with Alembic, a powerful database migration tool for Python.
- **Establish a Migration Workflow**:
    1. Initialize an Alembic environment within the repository.
    2. Create an initial migration that reflects the current database schema.
    3. Update the `supabase_sync.py` script to use Alembic to apply migrations.

## 3. Testing and Coverage

### Issues Identified

- **Limited Test Coverage**: While a test suite exists, there are opportunities to expand test coverage, particularly for the new database migration logic.

### Proposed Solutions

- **Write Tests for Database Migrations**: Add tests to verify that the Alembic migrations work as expected.
- **Increase Overall Test Coverage**: Review the existing codebase and add tests for any untested or undertested modules.

## 4. Documentation

### Issues Identified

- **Outdated Information**: The documentation may not reflect the latest changes, especially after implementing the proposed improvements.

### Proposed Solutions

- **Update README.md**: Revise the `README.md` file to include information about the new database migration workflow.
- **Generate API Documentation**: Consider using a tool like Sphinx to automatically generate API documentation from the docstrings.
