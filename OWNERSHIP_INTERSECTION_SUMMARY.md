## Key Finding: Shareholders Create Complex Group Intersections

### Shareholder Intersection Matrix

| Shareholder | Groups Involved | Entities Controlled | Intersection Type |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Pete | 3 | 11 | Multi-group intersection |
| Dan | 3 | 14 | Multi-group intersection |
| Jax | 2 | 10 | Multi-group intersection |

### Corporate Respondent Implications

#### Pete
- **Groups**: 3
- **Entities**: 11
- **Control Analysis**: {'shared_control_entities': 11, 'total_influence': 11, 'control_percentage_estimate': 'Potentially 50% in J_P, 33.3% in D_J_P, 50% in D_P'}
- **Legal Implications**:
  - Common control across 3 groups (J_P, D_J_P, D_P)
  - Intersection with both Jax and Dan creates complex web
  - Potential swing vote in D_J_P group decisions
  - Related party implications across 11 entities

#### Dan
- **Groups**: 3
- **Entities**: 14
- **Control Analysis**: {'direct_control_entities': 8, 'shared_control_entities': 6, 'total_influence': 14, 'control_percentage_estimate': 'Varies by entity - potentially 33.3% in D_J_P, 50% in D_P, 100% in D_Only'}
- **Legal Implications**:
  - Common control across 3 groups (D_J_P, D_P, D_Only)

#### Jax
- **Groups**: 2
- **Entities**: 10
- **Control Analysis**: {'shared_control_entities': 10, 'total_influence': 10, 'control_percentage_estimate': 'Potentially 50% in J_P, 33.3% in D_J_P'}
- **Legal Implications**:
  - Common control across 2 groups (J_P, D_J_P)
  - Shared control with Pete in J_P group

### Control Scenarios

#### Each shareholder controls only their direct holdings
- **Legal Group Formation**: No groups formed - all below control thresholds

#### Shareholders deemed to have control through intersections
- **Legal Group Formation**: Potential for deemed control groups

#### Shareholders acting in concert across intersections
- **Legal Group Formation**: Single group if concert party established
- **Regulatory Implications**: Would require disclosure and compliance as single group
