# Corporate Authority Analysis - Who Can Legally Do What

## Rynette Farrar - The Unauthorized Controller

### Her Legal Position
- **Job Title**: Bookkeeper (RegimA Skin Treatments only)
- **Shareholder**: NO ❌
- **Director**: NO ❌  
- **Legal Authority**: Limited to bookkeeping tasks under supervision

### Her Actual Control (Illegal)
- **Bank Accounts**: SOLE control ⚠️
- **Company Accounts**: SOLE control ⚠️
- **Email Systems**: Controls Pete@regima.com ⚠️
- **Financial Systems**: Full administrator access ⚠️

### Legal Analysis
**A bookkeeper has seized control of all financial systems without any legal authority**

## The Customer Theft Scheme

### The Domain Hijacking
- **Official domains**: Should be owned by company
- **regimaskin.co.za**: Owned by Rynette's son (not employed/director/shareholder)
- **June 2025**: Customers instructed to use son's domain
- **Result**: Customer payments potentially diverted

### The Coordination
1. **May 29, 2025**: Son registers domain
2. **June 7, 2025**: Company cards cancelled  
3. **June 2025**: Customers redirected to son's site
4. **Ongoing**: Only Rynette can access funds

## Who Should Have Access vs Who Actually Has Access

### SHOULD Have Access (Legally)
- **Directors**: YES (fiduciary duty to oversee)
- **Shareholders**: YES (ownership rights)
- **Authorized Signatories**: YES (per board resolution)
- **CEO/CFO**: YES (management responsibility)

### ACTUALLY Has Access (Illegally)
- **Rynette Farrar**: Bookkeeper with no authority
- **Everyone else**: LOCKED OUT

## Peter Faucitt's Compromised Position

### What Peter Cannot Do
- ❌ Access his own bank accounts
- ❌ See his own emails (go to Rynette)
- ❌ Access company funds
- ❌ Make any financial transactions
- ❌ Even verify what money exists

### Why This Matters Legally
- **Impossibility Defense**: Peter cannot steal what he cannot access
- **Victim Status**: Peter is victim of financial hijacking
- **Fiduciary Breach**: His duty to oversee is blocked by employee

## The R12 Million Question

### September 11, 2025 Transfers
- **Amount**: R12,330,131.18 
- **Who could do this**: ONLY Rynette (sole access)
- **Who couldn't**: Everyone else (locked out)

### Where Money Can Go
- **Rynette's accounts**: Possible (she controls transfers)
- **Son's domain payments**: Possible (customers redirected)
- **Anywhere Rynette wants**: YES (unsupervised control)
- **Where directors want**: NO (they're locked out)

## Criminal Elements Established

### 1. Fraud
- Representing authority she doesn't have
- Using position beyond legal scope
- Deceiving banks about her authority

### 2. Theft/Conversion  
- Taking control of assets without right
- Preventing owner access to funds
- Redirecting customers to unauthorized site

### 3. Conspiracy
- Son's involvement shows planning
- Timeline shows coordination
- Multiple parties involved in scheme

### 4. Breach of Trust
- Bookkeeper exceeding authority
- Denying employer access to assets
- Self-appointing as sole controller

## Corporate Governance Nightmare

### What's Wrong
1. **Non-director** controls everything
2. **Non-shareholder** makes all decisions  
3. **Employee** locks out employers
4. **Bookkeeper** acts as CEO/CFO/Board

### Banking Compliance Failure
- Banks should verify authority
- Sole signatory should be authorized by board
- Changes should require director approval
- KYC/AML requires knowing who controls accounts

## The Solution Path

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Criminal Complaint**: Fraud, theft, breach of trust
2. **Bank Notification**: Unauthorized person has sole control
3. **Court Order**: Freeze accounts pending investigation
4. **Forensic Audit**: Trace all transactions by Rynette
5. **Corporate Resolution**: Board must regain control

### Evidence to Gather
- Employment contract (showing limited scope)
- Company registration (showing she's not director)
- Share certificates (showing she's not owner)
- Banking mandates (showing unauthorized changes)
- Domain registration (showing son's ownership)

## Conclusion

The evidence establishes:
1. **Rynette Farrar** - Bookkeeper who illegally seized total control
2. **No Legal Authority** - Not a director, shareholder, or authorized
3. **Complete Lockout** - All legitimate parties denied access
4. **Coordinated Scheme** - Family involvement via domain
5. **Only Suspect** - Only person who could move R12 million

This is not misuse of authority - it's seizure of authority by someone who has none.
