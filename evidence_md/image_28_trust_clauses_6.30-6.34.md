## 6.30 To pay in specie or cash

In making payment at any time to any beneficiary of any portion of the trust fund in terms of this deed, the trustees shall be entitled to make any such payment either in cash or in specie or partly in cash and partly in specie. The trustees' valuation of any asset distributed by them in specie in terms hereof shall be final and binding on all interested parties.

## 6.31 Power to apply income for the maintenance, education or benefit of a beneficiary

The trustees may, in their sole and absolute discretion, use and apply the whole or any portion of the income of the trust assets for the maintenance, education (including university education in the Republic of South Africa or elsewhere), support, advancement and general welfare of any such beneficiary, setting him or her up in a business or a profession or fitting him or her for a career. Any income which may be so applied or used by the trustees in terms hereof may at their discretion be paid either to such beneficiary or to any other person or to any school or university on his or her behalf. If the income of the trust assets is, in the opinion of the trustees, insufficient for the aforementioned purposes or any of them, the trustees shall be entitled to apply or use so much of the capital of the trust as they may consider reasonable. Any capital so applied or used shall be brought (or not be brought) into account as part of the capital, share or interest to which any such beneficiary may become entitled.)

## 6.32 Power to apply capital for the advancement or benefit of a beneficiary

The trustees may during the trust period, in such manner as they in their absolute discretion deem fit, pay or apply any capital of the trust for the advancement or benefit of any person who may become entitled to such capital or of any share thereof, notwithstanding that such person will only become entitled thereto contingently on his or her attaining any specified age or subject to a gift over on his or her death under any specified age or that the interest of such person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which such person belongs and such payment or application may be made notwithstanding the occurrence of any other event provided that:

1. If any such person is or becomes absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to any share in the trust assets the capital so paid or applied shall be brought into account as part of such share;
2. in the event that the person to or on whose behalf such payment or application shall have been made does not attain a vested interest in the amount so paid or applied, neither he nor his estate shall be liable to make or to be called upon to make any restitution to the trustees or to the trust assets;
3. during the lifetime of the founder the trustees shall not pay or apply any capital to or for the benefit of any such person without the prior consent in writing of the founder.

In the event of a company or a unit trust scheme prohibiting, in terms of its articles or regulations, the transfer of shares or units into the names of the trustees as such, the shares or units shall be registered in their personal names or in the names of their representatives and shall be held as nominees on behalf of the trust.
