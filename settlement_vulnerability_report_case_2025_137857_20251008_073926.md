## CONCLUSION

This analysis demonstrates how vague settlement agreement terms create critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by self-representing parties to:

1. **Generate ongoing revenue streams** through party-owned wellness centers
2. **Obtain court-ordered company funding** for questionable professional services  
3. **Create permanent financial obligations** without meaningful oversight
4. **Exploit work-related stress diagnoses** to justify extensive treatments
5. **Use legal system enforcement** to protect exploitative arrangements

The vulnerabilities identified require immediate attention in settlement agreement drafting to prevent systematic financial exploitation through professional service appointments and ongoing treatment authorizations.

**Recommendation**: Settlement agreements must include specific terms of reference, conflict of interest screening, cost limitations, and independent review mechanisms to prevent the exploitation demonstrated in this analysis.
