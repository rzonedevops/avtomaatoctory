## Integration Architecture

### Component Integration
The framework integrates seamlessly with existing tools:

- **Verification Tracker** (`tools/verification_tracker.py`)
- **Knowledge Matrix** (`tools/knowledge_matrix.py`)
- **Timeline Validator** (`tools/timeline_validator.py`)
- **OCR Analyzer** (`tools/ocr_analyzer.py`)

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Raw data from various sources
2. **Processing**: Multi-component analysis
3. **Integration**: Cross-reference and validation
4. **Analysis**: Professional assessment generation
5. **Output**: Comprehensive reports and recommendations

## Professional Standards Implementation

### Language Processing
The framework automatically processes documents to ensure professional presentation:

- Removes emotional language ("SHOCKING" → "Notable")
- Replaces urgent indicators ("CRITICAL ALERT" → "Investigation findings indicate")
- Standardizes evidence presentation ("EVIDENCE SHOWS" → "Documentation indicates")
- Implements professional priority language ("URGENT ACTION" → "Priority attention")

### Professional Terminology Standards
- **Objective Terminology**: "Analysis indicates", "Documentation shows", "Evidence supports"
- **Risk Assessment**: Professional risk categorization instead of danger warnings
- **Evidence Presentation**: Documentation-based conclusions rather than subjective certainty
- **Recommendations**: Professional guidance instead of commands

## Usage Examples

### Basic Framework Initialization
```python
from hypergnn_framework import HyperGNNFramework, AnalysisConfiguration, AnalysisScope, ComplexityLevel

config = AnalysisConfiguration(
    case_id="case_001",
    scope=AnalysisScope.COMPREHENSIVE,
    complexity_level=ComplexityLevel.ADVANCED,
    professional_standards=True
)

framework = HyperGNNFramework(config)
```

### Adding Agents and Events
```python
# Add agents
framework.add_agent("agent_001", "John Smith", "individual", {"role": "subject"})
framework.add_agent("agent_002", "Jane Doe", "individual", {"role": "contact"})

# Add events
framework.add_event(
    "event_001",
    "Professional communication regarding case analysis",
    datetime.now(),
    ["agent_001", "agent_002"],
    "communication"
)
```

### Conducting Analysis
```python
# MMO Analysis
mmo_analysis = framework.analyze_motive_means_opportunity("agent_001", "event_001")

# Professional document processing
documents = ["document1.md", "document2.md"]
results = framework.process_documents_for_professional_language(documents)

# LLM/Transformer Analysis with Agent Perspectives
from frameworks.llm_transformer_schema import LLMTransformerSchema

transformer = LLMTransformerSchema(framework.case_id, embed_dim=512, num_heads=8)

# Create attention heads for different agent perspectives
transformer.create_attention_head_for_agent(victim_agent, "victim")
transformer.create_attention_head_for_agent(perpetrator_agent, "perpetrator")
transformer.create_attention_head_for_agent(witness_agent, "witness")

# Process timeline with transformer attention
timeline_events = list(framework.events.values())
transformer_analysis = transformer.process_timeline_with_attention(timeline_events, framework.agents)

# Results include:
# - Self-attention patterns for each agent perspective
# - Cross-attention correlations between perspectives
# - MMO-weighted attention distribution
# - Perspective conflict detection
# - Timeline insights with attention-based importance scoring

# Comprehensive analysis export
analysis = framework.export_comprehensive_analysis()
```
