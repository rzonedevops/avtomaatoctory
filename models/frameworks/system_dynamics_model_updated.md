# Enhanced Discrete-Event and System Dynamics Models

## 1. Introduction

This document enhances the discrete-event and system dynamics models for Case 2025_137857 based on new insights from the settlement agreement analysis. The models have been refined to incorporate the coercive mechanisms and weaponized medical testing identified in the settlement agreements, providing a more accurate representation of temporal sequences, event dependencies, feedback loops, and system-level leverage points.
