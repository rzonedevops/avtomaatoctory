## Critical Timeline Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: April 15, 2025 "Bank Accounts Redirected"

**Status**: ⚠️ UNCONFIRMED  
**Issue**: No documentary evidence provided for this claim  
**Recommendation**: Obtain bank correspondence, account change forms, or witness statements to validate

**Impact**: If validated, this would show systematic planning 37 days before May 22 audit trail hijacking

### Gap 2: June-August 2025 Bank Statements

**Status**: ⚠️ MISSING EVIDENCE  
**Issue**: Only March 2025 bank statement provided  
**Recommendation**: Subpoena June-August 2025 bank statements

**Critical Question**: Do June-August bank statements show continued credits, proving Shopify erasure is evidence destruction rather than business cessation?

**Expected Finding**: Continued customer payments (credits) during June-August 2025, proving operations continued but Shopify audit trails were destroyed.

### Gap 3: R 900,000 Transfer Recipients

**Status**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE INVESTIGATION  
**Issue**: Destination accounts for R 900K transfers not identified  
**Recommendation**: Subpoena bank records to trace transfer recipients

**Critical Questions**:
- Who authorized the transfers?
- Where did the funds go?
- Connection to Peter/Rynette entities?

### Gap 4: Shopify Deletion Timestamps

**Status**: ⚠️ MISSING TECHNICAL EVIDENCE  
**Issue**: Exact deletion timestamps and user access logs not provided  
**Recommendation**: Subpoena Shopify for complete audit logs

**Critical Evidence**: Would prove who deleted records and exact timing relative to May 15 confrontation.
